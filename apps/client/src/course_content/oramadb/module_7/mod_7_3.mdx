# The Orama CLI: Bulk Ingestion

Writing `insert()` calls for 100,000 items is tedious. The **Orama CLI** allows you to manage your indexes and data from your terminal.

---

## 1. Installation

```bash
npm install -g @oramacloud/cli
```

---

## 2. Importing from CSV/JSON

If you have a large dataset in another format, you can pipe it directly into Orama.

```bash
cat products.json | orama-cli import --index my-index
```

---

## 3. Local Development

The CLI also allows you to:

- **Test queries:** Run searches in the terminal to see what the score and results look like.
- **Manage Indices:** Create, delete, and list your indices on Orama Cloud.
- **Deploy:** "Push" your local code and index settings to the production cloud.

---

## Real-World Example: Migrate from SQL to Search

A data engineer has 500,000 rows in a PostgreSQL table. They want to make them searchable in Orama.

- They run a SQL command: `COPY products TO STDOUT WITH CSV`.
- They pipe that output directly into the Orama CLI: `... | orama-cli import`.
- In less than 5 minutes, their entire database is now a high-performance search index.

---

## Hypothetical Scenario: The "Quick Test"

A developer is wondering if "Boost: 2" or "Boost: 5" is better for their specific data.

- Instead of re-building their web app 10 times...
- **The Solution:** They use the CLI to run the same search with different boost flags and compare the results in seconds.

## Exercises

1. **Commands:** How do you test a query using the Orama CLI?
2. **Migration:** What file formats can the Orama CLI import?
3. **Logic:** Why is a CLI better than a web browser for importing 1GB of data?

## Summary and Next Steps

The CLI is your "Swiss Army Knife" for data management.
