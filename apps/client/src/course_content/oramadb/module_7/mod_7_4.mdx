# OramaDB Mastery: Final Project

You have learned everything from basic schemas to AI-powered vector search. Now, it's time to build a real-world application.

---

## The Graduation Challenge

You are building the search engine for **"The Developer's Library"**—a site with 5,000 articles, videos, and tutorials.

### The Requirements:

1. **Schema:** Create a schema with `title` (string), `type` (enum), `tags` (string[]), and `popularity` (number).
2. **Relevancy:** Boost the `title` field by 2.0.
3. **Filtering:** Allow users to filter by `type` (e.g., only "Videos").
4. **Hybrid Search:** Enable a `vector` field so users can search for "How do I optimize code?" without using those exact words.
5. **UI Support:** Enable Highlighting on the `title` field so users see their keywords.

### The Task:

Write a JavaScript/TypeScript script that initializes this index, inserts at least 5 dummy documents, and performs a "Hybrid Search" that returns results filtered by a specific category.

## OramaDB Recap: What You've Learned

1. **Edge Search:** Running search in the browser and at the edge for 0ms latency.
2. **Schema Control:** types like `enum`, `geopoint`, and `vector`.
3. **Advanced Querying:** Using the DSL for filters, facets, and pagination.
4. **AI Capabilities:** Using OpenAI/HuggingFace embeddings for Vector and Hybrid search.
5. **Deployment:** Using Orama Cloud and snapshots to manage production data.

## Final Thoughts

The web is moving away from "Centralized everything." Users expect speed, and OramaDB is the engine that provides it. By masterinig Orama, you are now a "Search Architect"—capable of building systems that are not just fast, but intelligent.

**Next Steps for You:**

- Create a free account at **OramaCloud.com**.
- Build an **Astro** or **Next.js** site and add a search bar.
- Try building a **RAG Chatbot** using Orama as the memory unit.

**Congratulations on completing the course!**
