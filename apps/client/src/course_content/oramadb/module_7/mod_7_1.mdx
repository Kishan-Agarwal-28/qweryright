# Orama + Modern Web Frameworks

Orama is a favorite for developers using "Static Site Generators" like **Next.js**, **Astro**, and **Nuxt**. In this lesson, we learn how to implement "Static Search."

---

## 1. The "Build-Time" Indexing

In Astro or Next.js, you have a `build` step.

- You write a script that iterates over your content folders.
- It builds the Orama index.
- It saves it as a JSON file in the `/public` folder.

---

## 2. The Frontend Hook

On your website, you use a React or Vue hook to load the index.

```javascript
// React Example
const [db, setDb] = useState(null)

useEffect(() => {
  async function init() {
    const response = await fetch('/search-index.json')
    const data = await response.json()
    const orama = await create({ schema: { ... } })
    await load(orama, data)
    setDb(orama)
  }
  init()
}, [])
```

## 3. Why this "Wins"

This approach is **Serverless**.

- You don't need a database server.
- You don't need an API.
- Your search is as fast as a local JSON file—because it _is_ a local JSON file.

---

## Real-World Example: Documentation Search

The official documentation for many JavaScript libraries use Orama.

- When you land on the page, the browser silently downloads the index.
- When you type in the search bar, the UI updates instantly.
- Even if the library's server goes down, the search on the page still works because the index is already in your browser's memory.

---

## Hypothetical Scenario: The "Massive" Site

A site has 50,000 pages. The JSON index is 15MB.

- **The Problem:** 15MB is too big for a single download.
- **The Solution:** Instead of a "Static" search, they use **Orama Cloud**.
- The search bar sends a small request to the Cloud, which only returns the top 10 results (kb-sized), keeping the user's browser fast.

## Exercises

1. **Frameworks:** Which web framework "Build" step is best for generating Orama indexes?
2. **Setup:** Where should you store your `search-index.json` file?
3. **Logic:** Why is static search "Serverless"?

## Summary and Next Steps

Orama + Modern Web = Instant Search.

Next, we look at **Orama in Deno and Node.js** for server-side environments.
