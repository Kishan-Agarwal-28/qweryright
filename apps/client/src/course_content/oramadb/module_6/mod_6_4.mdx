# Tokenizer Pipelines

A Tokenizer Pipeline is the "Factory Line" that your text travels through before it is saved. You can add your own "Steps" to this line.

---

## 1. The Standard Pipeline

1. **Lowercase:** "Apple" -> "apple".
2. **Stopwords:** Remove "the", "and".
3. **Stemming:** "Running" -> "run".

---

## 2. Adding Custom Steps

You might want to add a step for **Normalization**.

- **Example:** You want "café" to be treated the same as "cafe".
- You add a "Normalizer" step that removes accent marks from letters.

---

## 3. High-Performance Tokenization

If your pipeline is too complex (e.g., you are running a heavy AI model for every word), your indexing speed will slow down.

- **The Solution:** Keep your tokenizer pipeline as "Lean" (fast) as possible. Do heavy processing (like LLM translations) **before** you send the data to Orama.

---

## Real-World Example: Medical Abbreviations

In a hospital database, "BP" always means "Blood Pressure."

- **The Solution:** The developer adds a step to the pipeline:
  - If word is 'BP', replace with 'Blood Pressure'.
- Now, when a researcher searches for "Blood Pressure," Orama finds every document where the doctor just typed "BP."

## Hypothetical Scenario: The "Emoji" Search

A Gen-Z social app wants users to be able to search using emojis.

- **The Problem:** Many tokenizers ignore emojis entirely.
- **The Solution:** The developer creates a custom pipeline step that "Translates" emojis into words.
- 🔥 becomes "fire".
- Now, a search for the word "Fire" returns todos or posts containing the fire emoji.

## Exercises

1. **Review:** List the three standard steps in an Orama tokenizer pipeline.
2. **Transformation:** How would you handle translating "US", "U.S.A.", and "United States" into a single searchable term?
3. **Logic:** Why is "normalization" important for searching names (like 'Renée')?

## Summary and Next Steps

Pipelines give you surgical control over your search data.

We wrap up Module 6 in the next lesson.
