# Search Highlighting

Search is only useful if the user knows _why_ a result was returned. **Highlighting** wraps the matching words in a specific tag (like `<b>` or `<mark>`).

---

## 1. Enabling Highlighting

In your search query, you tell Orama which fields you want to highlight.

```javascript
const result = await search(db, {
  term: 'wireless',
  highlight: {
    properties: ['description'],
  },
})
```

---

## 2. Using the "Snippets"

Orama doesn't just give you the whole text; it gives you a **Snippet**—a small piece of text around the match so the user doesn't have to read a 10-page document.

```javascript
// Result might look like this:
// "...the best [wireless] headphones for travel..."
```

## 3. Highlighting in the UI

On the frontend, you take the highlighted string and render it as HTML.

- _Pro Tip:_ Always sanitize your search results before rendering them as HTML to prevent XSS (Security) attacks!

## Real-World Example: News Article Previews

A user searches for "Mars Rover."

- The search results show 10 articles.
- Each article has a 20-word snippet below the headline.
- The words "Mars" and "Rover" are bolded in every snippet.
- The user can quickly scan the snippets to find the specific article about the "Perseverance" landing.

## Hypothetical Scenario: The "Invisible" Match

A user searches for "Waterproof." A result is returned, but the word "Waterproof" isn't in the title.

- **The Problem:** The user is confused. They think the search engine is broken.
- **The Solution:** Highlighting reveals that the word "Waterproof" was hidden in the **"Detailed Specs"** section.
- Highlighting provides "Transparency" to the search engine.

## Exercises

1. **Setup:** Which parameter in the `search` function enables highlighting?
2. **UX:** Why is it better to show a "Snippet" rather than the "Full Text"?
3. **Security:** What is one risk of rendering search results directly as HTML? (Hint: See the Pro Tip above).

## Summary and Next Steps

Highlighting turns raw data into a readable list of options.

Next, we look at **Advanced Boosting**—how to manually override Orama's scoring logic.
