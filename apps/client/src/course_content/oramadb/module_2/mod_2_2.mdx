# Tokenization and Stemming

How does Orama know that a search for "running" should also find documents containing the word "run"? The answer is **Tokenization** and **Stemming**.

## 1. What is Tokenization?

Tokenization is the process of breaking a sentence into individual words (tokens).

- **Sentence:** "The quick brown fox."
- **Tokens:** `the`, `quick`, `brown`, `fox`.

Orama automatically removes punctuation and converts everything to lowercase to make the search case-insensitive.

## 2. What is Stemming?

Stemming is the process of reducing a word to its "root" form.

- **Words:** `fishing`, `fished`, `fisher`.
- **Root (Stem):** `fish`.

By indexing the stem instead of the full word, Orama saves space and makes the search more "intelligent."

## 3. Custom Tokenizers

Sometimes, the default rules don't work. For example, in a medical database, you might not want to stem the word "Operating" to "Operate."

- Orama allows you to define **Custom Tokenizers** if you need total control over how words are split.

## Real-World Example: The Fashion Blog

A user searches for "Dresses."

- **Without Stemming:** The engine only finds documents with the exact word "Dresses." It misses a post titled "Summer Dress."
- **With Orama's Stemming:** Orama reduces "Dresses" to "Dress." It successfully finds both the plural and singular versions of the word.

## Hypothetical Scenario: The "Part Number" Problem

A hardware store wants users to search for part numbers like `BC-123-X`.

- **The Problem:** A standard tokenizer might split this into `BC`, `123`, and `X`.
- **The Solution:** The developer creates a custom tokenizer that keeps the dashes intact, so a search for `BC-123` returns the correct result.

## Exercises

1. **Definitions:** What is the difference between a "Token" and a "Stem"?
2. **Logic:** Why is stemming important for a good user experience?
3. **Practice:** What is the stem of the word "Computers"?

## Summary and Next Steps

Stemming makes search human-friendly.

Next, we look at how Orama handles **Multiple Languages**—because search isn't just in English!
