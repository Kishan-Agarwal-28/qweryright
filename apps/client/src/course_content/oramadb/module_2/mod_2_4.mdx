# Stopwords and Boosting

Not all words are created equal. Some words are useless "noise," and some words are strictly more important than others.

---

## 1. Stopwords

Stopwords are common words like "the", "and", "is", and "at."

- Because they appear in almost **every** document, they are useless for search.
- Orama filters these out by default to save memory and improve speed.
- **You can also add your own:** If you have a search engine for "Coffee", the word "beans" might appear too often. You can add "beans" to your custom stopwords list.

## 2. Term Boosting

Boosting allows you to make certain fields more important.

- If a word appears in the **Title**, it should probably rank higher than if it appears in the **Description**.

```javascript
const results = await search(db, {
  term: 'wireless headphones',
  boost: {
    title: 2, // The Title is twice as important
    description: 1, // The Description is standard
  },
})
```

## 3. Typo Tolerance

Orama has built-in typo tolerance.

- A search for "iPone" will still find "iPhone."
- You can configure how "strict" this is using the `tolerance` parameter.

## Real-World Example: News Search

A news website wants to prioritize "Breaking News" headlines.

- They boost the `headline` field by **1.5**.
- They boost the `category` field (like "URGENT") by **2.0**.
- This ensures that when a user searches for a keyword, the most important alerts appear at the top of the list, even if the keyword appears many times in the body of a less important article.

---

## Hypothetical Scenario: The "Junk" Search

A user keeps searching for the word "What is the best way to..."

- **The Result:** Orama ignores "What", "is", "the", and "to".
- It only performs the search on the words **"best way"**.
- This makes the search faster because it has fewer keywords to match.

## Exercises

1. **Definitions:** What is a "Stopword"?
2. **Relevancy:** Why would you boost a `title` field higher than a `body` field?
3. **Typos:** If you want to find "Apple" when searching for "Appel," which feature are you using?

## Summary and Next Steps

Boosting and stopwords turn a "Basic" search into a "Professional" search.

We wrap up Module 2 in the next lesson.
