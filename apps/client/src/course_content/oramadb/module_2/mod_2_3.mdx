# Multilingual Search

The world is global. If you build a search for a Japanese audience, "English Stemming" will fail completely. Orama makes it easy to handle multiple languages.

---

## 1. Language-Specific Stemmers

Orama supports dozens of languages (French, Spanish, Italian, Japanese, etc.). Each language has its own unique grammar rules.

```javascript
const db = await create({
  schema: { ... },
  components: {
    tokenizer: {
      language: 'spanish' // Orama now uses Spanish stemming rules
    }
  }
})
```

## 2. Why Language Matters

In English, to make a word plural, you usually add "s". In other languages, the rules are much more complex.

- Using the correct language setting ensures that your "root" words are accurate.

---

## 3. The "Custom" Dictionary

You can also provide a dictionary of words that should **never** be changed or stemmed. This is great for Brand Names (e.g., you don't want "Nike" to be stemmed to "Nik").

## Real-World Example: The Global Travel App

A travel app allows users to search for hotels in Mexico and the USA.

- For the Mexico index, they set the language to `'spanish'`.
- For the USA index, they set it to `'english'`.
- When a user searches for "Habitaciones" (rooms), the Spanish index correctly stems it to "Habitacion," finding all relevant results.

## Hypothetical Scenario: The "Automatic Detect"

A developer wants Orama to "guess" the user's language.

- **The Reality:** Orama does not detect language automatically. You must tell it which language you are using when you create the index.
- _A common pattern is to detect the user's browser language on the frontend and then load the corresponding Orama index._

## Exercises

1. **Setup:** How do you set the language for an Orama index?
2. **Comparison:** Why can't you use the English stemmer for a Spanish website?
3. **Application:** Name three languages (other than English) that Orama supports.

## Summary and Next Steps

Language support ensures your search feels "Native" to your users.
