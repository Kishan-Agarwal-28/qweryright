# Advanced Schema Types

OramaDB's schema isn't just for strings and numbers. It has specialized types that help it understand the _meaning_ of your data.

---

## 1. The `enum` Type

If a field can only have a few specific values (like `color` or `priority`), use `enum`.

- This is much more memory-efficient than storing the same string over and over.

```javascript
schema: {
  priority: 'enum', // allowed: 'high', 'medium', 'low'
}
```

---

## 2. Geosearch with `geopoint`

If you are building a "Store Locator," you need to store coordinates.

- Orama has a built-in `geopoint` type.

```javascript
schema: {
  location: 'geopoint'
}
// Data: { lat: 40.7128, lon: -74.0060 }
```

---

## 3. The `string[]` (List of Strings)

Useful for tags or categories.

- If you search for "Action," Orama will find any document where "Action" appears in the `tags` list.

```javascript
schema: {
  tags: 'string[]'
}
```

## Real-World Example: Real Estate Search

A real estate app uses Orama to search listings.

- **`status`** is an `enum` ('for sale', 'sold', 'pending').
- **`location`** is a `geopoint`.
- **`features`** is a `string[]` ('pool', 'gym', 'balcony').
- This schema allows the user to perform complex searches like: "Find all **sold** homes with a **pool** within 2 miles of my location."

## Hypothetical Scenario: The "Date" Confusion

A developer wants to search for documents created "Last Week."

- **The Solution:** They use the `number` type to store a Unix Timestamp (e.g., `1700000000`).
- Orama allows you to filter ranges: `WHERE timestamp > 1699000000`.

## Exercises

1. **Efficiency:** Why is `enum` better than `string` for limited categories?
2. **Features:** How would you store a list of product "Colors" in Orama?
3. **Geo:** What are the two keys required in a `geopoint` object?

## Summary and Next Steps

Advanced types make your data searchable in more ways than just text.

In the next lesson, we’ll look at **Tokenization**—how Orama actually "reads" and breaks down your text.
