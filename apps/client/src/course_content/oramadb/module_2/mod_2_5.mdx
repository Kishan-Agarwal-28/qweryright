# Module 2 - Summary

In this module, we moved beyond basic setup and looked at how Orama treats data at a granular level.

---

## What we covered:

- **Advanced Types:** Using `enum`, `geopoint`, and `string[]` to create rich schemas.
- **Tokenization:** How Orama splits sentences into searchable chunks.
- **Stemming:** Reducing words to their root forms to catch plural and tense variations.
- **Multilingual Support:** Using language-specific grammars for global apps.
- **Boosting:** Tuning search relevancy to ensure the most important results appear first.

---

## Key Takeaway

Indexing isn't just about saving data; it's about **pre-processing** it. By choosing the right language, stemmer, and boosts, you ensure that Orama understands the _intent_ of your users' searches.

## Up Next: Module 3 - Search Query DSL

Now that our index is perfect, it's time to query it! In the next module, we'll learn how to use **Filters**, **Facets**, and **Pagination** to build a modern search interface.
