# Health and Monitoring

Search is a "living" thing. As your data changes, your search results might degrade. You need to monitor the **Health** of your Orama index.

## 1. Indexing Speed

How long does it take to update your index?

- If you are re-indexing 10,000 items every minute, you might see "Spikes" in CPU usage.
- Orama is very optimized, but for massive updates, it is better to perform them in a **Background Worker** rather than on the main web server.

---

## 2. Hit Rate (Recall)

A "Good" search results in a "Hit" (the user clicks something).

- A "Bad" search results in 0 items found.
- If your "0 Results" count is climbing, it usually means your users are using search terms you haven't considered (e.g., nicknames, abbreviations, or multiple languages).

---

## 3. Query Latency

Latency is the time it takes for a user's query to return results.

- **Goal:** < 50ms for local search.
- **Goal:** < 150ms for cloud search.
- If latency is high, check your `offset` (pagination) or the size of your `filters`.

## Real-World Example: The "Autocomplete" Monitoring

A search bar has an "Autocomplete" feature that triggers on every keystroke.

- The company notices that their server is being "DDoS'ed" by its own users—every user is sending 10 requests per second!
- **The Solution:** They add a **Debounce** (wait 300ms before searching).
- They move the Autocomplete index to the **Client-Side**, so there are zero server requests.
- Result: Server load drops by 95% and the UI feels smoother.

## Hypothetical Scenario: The "Zombie" Results

A user searches for a product that was deleted yesterday, but it still appears in the search results.

- **The Cause:** The Orama index hasn't been "Rehydrated" with the new data.
- **The Fix:** Implement a "Refresh Interval" or use Orama Cloud Webhooks to ensure the search index is updated within minutes of a database change.

## Exercises

1. **Automation:** Why should you automate your re-indexing process?
2. **Metrics:** What does a high "0 Results" count indicate?
3. **UX:** How does "Debouncing" improve both the user experience and server health?

## Summary and Next Steps

Monitoring ensures that your search engine stays fast and relevant over time.

We wrap up Module 5 in the next lesson.
