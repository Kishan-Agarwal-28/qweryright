# Client-side vs. Server-side Search

One of the biggest questions with Orama is: **"Where should the search happen?"** Both approaches have pros and cons.

---

## 1. Client-Side (Browser) Search

The Orama index is downloaded to the user's computer.

- **Pros:**
  - Sub-millisecond search (no network lag).
  - Works offline.
  - Zero server costs for search.
- **Cons:**
  - User has to download the index (bad for indices > 5MB).
  - Data is visible in the browser (bad for private data).

---

## 2. Server-Side (Edge) Search

The index lives on a server (or Orama Cloud). The browser sends a request to it.

- **Pros:**
  - Can handle massive datasets (GBs of data).
  - Data is secure (private).
  - Very small initial page load.
- **Cons:**
  - Subject to network latency.
  - Costs money to run the server/cloud.

## 3. The "Hybrid" Rule of Thumb

- **Use Client-Side** for: Documentation, small blogs, mobile apps with offline modes (< 10,000 documents).
- **Use Server-Side/Cloud** for: E-commerce with millions of items, medical records, or user-specific private data.

## Real-World Example: Mobile App Offline Search

A field technician app has 5,000 service manuals.

- The technician often works in basements with no Wi-Fi.
- **Deployment:** The app downloads the Orama index when the technician is at the office.
- Now, they can search for "Boiler Model X-2" in the basement and get instant results offline.

## Hypothetical Scenario: The "Secret" Price List

A company has a list of "Wholesale Prices" that should only be seen by specific partners.

- **The Problem:** If they use Client-Side search, a smart user could open the browser's "Network" tab and see the entire price list.
- **The Solution:** They must use **Server-Side search** and verify the user's identity (Authentication) before returning the results.

## Exercises

1. **Trade-offs:** Name one advantage of Server-Side search.
2. **Performance:** Why should you avoid Client-Side search for a 100MB index?
3. **Security:** Which deployment pattern is more secure for private data?

## Summary and Next Steps

Choosing the right pattern is about balancing speed with security.

In the next lesson, we wrap up with some **Monitoring and Quality** tips.
