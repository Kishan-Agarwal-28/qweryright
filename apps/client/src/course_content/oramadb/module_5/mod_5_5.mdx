# Module 5 - Summary

In this module, we looked at how to take Orama from a "Local Demo" to a "Production Service."

---

## What we covered:

- **Persistence:** How to save and load Orama indexes using JSON snapshots.
- **Orama Cloud:** Using a global network to provide 10ms search results to any user, anywhere.
- **Deployment Patterns:** Deciding between the zero-lag of Client-Side search and the security/scale of Server-Side search.
- **Monitoring:** Tracking analytics, latency, and "0 Result" searches to continuously improve the user experience.

---

## Key Takeaway

Orama's flexibility is its greatest strength. Whether you need a local index for an offline mobile app or a globally distributed search for a massive e-commerce site, Orama can scale to fit your needs.
