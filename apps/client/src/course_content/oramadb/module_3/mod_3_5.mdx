# Module 3 - Summary

We've mastered the Orama Query DSL.

---

## What we covered:

- **Basic Search:** Using `term`, `properties`, and `tolerance` for typo-tolerant matching.
- **Filtering:** Using the `where` block to restrict results by price, stock, or boolean conditions.
- **Faceting:** Generating category counts and price brackets dynamically.
- **Sorting & Pagination:** Managing large result sets and ordering data by relevancy, price, or time.

---

## Key Takeaway

Search is more than just finding words. It’s a combination of **Relevancy** (finding the match), **Filtering** (narrowing the data), and **Navigation** (using facets and pagination) that builds a great user experience.

## Up Next: Module 4 - Vector Search & RAG

The world of search is changing. In the next module, we move beyond "Words" and into "Meanings." We'll learn how to use **Vector Search** and **LLM Embeddings** with Orama.
