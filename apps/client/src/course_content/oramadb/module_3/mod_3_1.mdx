# Basic Search & Typo Tolerance

Searching in Orama is centered around the `search` function. It’s designed to be simple for beginners but powerful for pros.

---

## 1. The Simplest Search

To search for a word, you just provide a `term`.

```javascript
const result = await search(db, {
  term: 'pizza',
})
```

Orama will look for "pizza" in **all** string fields of your schema.

---

## 2. Searching Specific Fields

If you only want to search the `title`, you can specify it.

```javascript
const result = await search(db, {
  term: 'margherita',
  properties: ['title'],
})
```

---

## 3. Typo Tolerance (Fuzzy Search)

Users make mistakes. Orama allows you to configure how many mistakes are allowed.

```javascript
const result = await search(db, {
  term: 'pizaa', // Typo!
  tolerance: 1, // Allow 1 character error
})
```

_A tolerance of 1 will find "pizza". A tolerance of 2 would find "piazza"._

## Real-World Example: The Library App

A user is searching for a book titled "The Great Gatsby."

- They type "The Great Gatsy" (oops, forgot the 'b').
- Because the library app has `tolerance: 1` enabled, Orama still returns the correct book at the #1 position.
- This prevents the user from thinking the library doesn't have the book.

---

## Hypothetical Scenario: The "Too Fuzzy" Search

A developer sets `tolerance: 5` because they want to be "very helpful."

- **The Result:** A search for "Cat" returns "Bat", "Hat", "Car", "Can", and "Cab".
- The results are now "noisy" and useless.
- **The Lesson:** Usually, a tolerance of **1 or 2** is the "Sweet Spot" for search engines.

## Exercises

1. **Parameters:** What happens if you don't provide a `properties` array?
2. **Tolerance:** If a user types "Apple" but the database says "Aple", what tolerance level is needed?
3. **Application:** Write a search query that searches for the term "Wireless" only in the `category` and `tags` fields.

## Summary and Next Steps

Basic search is great, but real apps need to "narrow down" results.

In the next lesson, we’ll learn about **Filtering**—how to restrict results by price, date, or category.
