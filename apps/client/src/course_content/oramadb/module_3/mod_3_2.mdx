# Filtering Results

Search finds the relevant text, but **Filters** exclude things that shouldn't be there (e.g., "Show me results, but only if they are under $50").

---

## 1. Where Filters Happen

Filters are placed in the `where` block of your search query.

```javascript
const result = await search(db, {
  term: 'shoes',
  where: {
    price: {
      between: [10, 50], // Range filter
    },
    inStock: true, // Boolean filter
  },
})
```

## 2. Supported Operators

Orama supports several comparison operators:

- `eq`: Equal to.
- `gt` / `gte`: Greater than / or equal to.
- `lt` / `lte`: Less than / or equal to.
- `between`: Value inside a range.

---

## 3. Combining Filters

You can filter by multiple fields at once. Orama treats multiple filters in the `where` block as an **AND** operation (all conditions must be met).

---

## Real-World Example: Real Estate Price Tiers

A user is searching for "Apartments" in New York.

- They have a budget of $3,000.
- Their search query:

```javascript
where: {
  city: 'New York',
  rent: { lt: 3000 }
}
```

- Even if there is a beautiful $5,000 apartment that matches the "Apartment New York" text perfectly, Orama will hide it because it fails the filter.

---

## Hypothetical Scenario: The "In Stock" Toggle

A customer on an e-commerce site clicks a checkbox that says "Hide Out of Stock."

- **The Solution:** The developer adds `inStock: true` to the `where` object.
- Now, the search results only show ready-to-ship products, reducing customer frustration.

## Exercises

1. **Syntax:** How do you search for items with a price "Greater than 100"?
2. **Logic:** Does Orama's `where` block use `AND` or `OR` by default for multiple fields?
3. **Drafting:** Write a filter that finds products in the `category` of 'electronics' that have more than 5 `reviews`.

## Summary and Next Steps

Filters help users find exactly what they need.

Next, we look at **Facets**—the feature that powers those "Category Sidebar" counts on websites like Amazon.
