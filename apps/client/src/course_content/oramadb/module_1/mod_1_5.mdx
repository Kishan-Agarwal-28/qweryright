# Module 1 - Summary

We've laid the groundwork for OramaDB.

---

## What we covered:

- **What Orama is:** A dependency-free, TypeScript search engine for the Edge and Browser.
- **Architecture:** Understanding In-Memory storage and the power of the Inverted Index.
- **Positioning:** Knowing when to choose Orama over heavyweight tools like Elasticsearch or analytical tools like DuckDB.
- **Getting Started:** How to define a schema and insert data into an index.

---

## Key Takeaway

Orama is optimized for **latency**. By moving the search engine closer to the user (the Edge or the Browser), you eliminate the slowest part of modern apps: the network round-trip to a database server.

## Up Next: Module 2 - Schema & Ingestion

In the next module, we'll look at advanced schema features like **Custom Tokenizers**, **Stopwords**, and how to handle **Multiple Languages** in your search index.
