# Orama vs. The Giants

Choosing the right tool depends on your data size and where you want the search to happen. Let’s compare OramaDB to other popular engines.

## 1. Orama vs. Elasticsearch

| Feature         | OramaDB                   | Elasticsearch             |
| :-------------- | :------------------------ | :------------------------ |
| **Setup**       | Zero Config (NPM Install) | Complex Cluster Setup     |
| **Memory**      | Low (MBs)                 | High (GBs)                |
| **Scalability** | Best for < 1M docs        | Best for Billions of docs |
| **Environment** | Browser / Edge / Server   | Server Only               |

**Verdict:** Use Orama for user-facing search and "Speed-at-the-Edge." Use Elasticsearch for massive log analysis and enterprise-scale data warehouses.

## 2. Orama vs. DuckDB

| Feature          | OramaDB               | DuckDB                 |
| :--------------- | :-------------------- | :--------------------- |
| **Primary Goal** | Search & Relevancy    | Analytical SQL         |
| **Logic**        | Typo Tolerance / BM25 | Aggregations / Joins   |
| **Language**     | TypeScript / JS       | C++ (with JS bindings) |

**Verdict:** Use Orama if you want a "Search Bar" (searching for "Appel" and finding "Apple"). Use DuckDB if you want to calculate the "Average Sales in Q3" across a million rows.

## Real-World Example: The Documentation Site

A company has 2,000 pages of text.

- **Elasticsearch** is overkill. It would cost $20/month just to keep the server running.
- **DuckDB** is too rigid. It's hard to handle "typo tolerance" elegantly in pure SQL.
- **Orama** is perfect. It's free to host on the edge and provides a "Did you mean...?" experience for the user.

## Hypothetical Scenario: The "Mobile First" App

You are building a mobile app that needs to search 50,000 local news articles.

- You want the search to work even without Wi-Fi.
- Orama is the only candidate here—it runs directly inside the mobile app's JavaScript runtime.

## Exercises

1. **Trade-off:** What is one thing Elasticsearch can do that Orama cannot?
2. **Relevancy:** Why is DuckDB not the best tool for a "Search Bar"?
3. **Cost:** Why is Orama often cheaper to run than Elasticsearch?

## Summary and Next Steps

Now you know _why_ to use Orama. Let's learn _how_ to use it.
