# Your First Orama Index

Let's get practical. To start searching, you need two things: a **Schema** and an **Instance**.

---

## 1. Defining the Schema

Orama needs to know what types of data you are storing so it can optimize the index.

```javascript
import { create } from '@oramacloud/client' // Or @orama/orama for local

const db = await create({
  schema: {
    title: 'string',
    description: 'string',
    price: 'number',
    isAvailable: 'boolean',
    metadata: {
      category: 'string',
    },
  },
})
```

---

## 2. Adding Data

Once the index is created, adding data is as simple as calling `insert`.

```javascript
await insert(db, {
  title: 'Mechanical Keyboard',
  description: 'A clicky RGB keyboard for developers.',
  price: 120,
  isAvailable: true,
  metadata: {
    category: 'electronics',
  },
})
```

---

## 3. The "Batch" Insert

If you have thousands of items, don't insert them one by one. Use `insertMultiple` to speed up the indexing process.

```javascript
const products = [ { ... }, { ... } ];
await insertMultiple(db, products);
```

## Real-World Example: Syncing a Website

A blogger uses a Static Site Generator (like Next.js or Astro).

- During the "Build" step, the script reads all 500 Markdown files.
- It inserts the title and content of each file into an Orama index.
- It saves the index as `search-index.json`.
- The website loads this JSON file, and now the entire blog is searchable in milliseconds.

---

## Hypothetical Scenario: The "Schema Mismatch"

A developer tries to insert a price as a string (`"120"`) into a column defined as a `number`.

- **Result:** Orama will throw an error.
- This protects your search results from being "corrupted" by bad data types.

## Exercises

1. **Setup:** What are the basic data types allowed in an Orama schema?
2. **Performance:** Why should you use `insertMultiple` for large datasets?
3. **Action:** Write a schema for a "Movie Database" with fields for `title`, `year`, and `rating`.

## Summary and Next Steps

You've built your first index and added data. Now comes the fun part: **Searching.**

In the next module, we'll dive deep into the **Orama Query DSL**.
