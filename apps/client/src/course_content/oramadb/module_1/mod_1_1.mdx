# What is OramaDB?

OramaDB (formerly known as Orama) is a **next-generation search engine** designed for speed, simplicity, and the modern web.

While databases like PostgreSQL are great at storage, and Elasticsearch is great for big clusters, Orama focuses on one thing: **Lightning-fast search at the edge.**

## 1. The Core Mission

Orama was built to run anywhere:

- In the **Browser** (Client-side search).
- In **Node.js/Deno/Bun** (Server-side search).
- At the **Edge** (Cloudflare Workers, Vercel Functions).

It is written in TypeScript and has **zero dependencies**, making it incredibly lightweight and easy to deploy.

## 2. Key Features

1. **Full-Text Search:** Typo tolerance, stemming, and stop-word removal out of the box.
2. **Vector Search:** Support for AI-powered embeddings and "semantic" search.
3. **Hybrid Search:** Combine traditional text matching with modern AI vectors.
4. **Faceting:** Quickly group results (e.g., "Show me all products in the 'Electronics' category").
5. **Typed Schema:** Unlike some NoSQL databases, Orama encourages a strict schema for better performance.

## Real-World Example: The E-commerce Search Bar

Imagine you have a website with 10,000 products.

- Traditional way: User types a word -> Frontend sends request to API -> API queries Database -> Result sent back.
- **The Orama way:** You load the Orama index (a small JSON file) directly into the user's browser. As the user types, Orama searches the 10,000 products **on the user's phone** in less than 1 millisecond. No network requests needed.

## Hypothetical Scenario: The "Offline" Documentation

A software company wants their documentation to be searchable even when the user is offline.

- **The Solution:** They bundle an Orama search index with their web app.
- Because Orama is just a JavaScript library, it can handle the search locally without ever talking to a server.

## Exercises

1. **Deployment:** Name three environments where OramaDB can run.
2. **Comparison:** How is Orama different from a traditional database like PostgreSQL?
3. **Typed Search:** Why does Orama use a "Schema" if it's a JavaScript-native tool?

## Summary and Next Steps

OramaDB is redefining where search happens. It moves the power from the central server to the "Edge."

In the next lesson, we’ll look at the **Architecture** that makes this possible.
