# Hybrid Search: The Best of Both Worlds

Keyword search is precise. Vector search is semantic. **Hybrid Search** combines them both into a single query.

## 1. Why Hybrid?

- **Vector Only:** If you search for a specific serial number like "A1-B2-C3," Vector search might fail because it doesn't "Mean" anything.
- **Keyword Only:** If you search for "Feeling happy," Keyword search might fail if the document uses the word "Joy" instead.

**Hybrid Search** uses keywords for precision and vectors for conceptual matching.

## 2. How to do it in Orama

You simply provide both a `term` and a `vector` in the search parameters.

```javascript
const result = await search(db, {
  term: 'iPhone',
  vector: {
    value: [...],
    property: 'embedding'
  },
  mode: 'hybrid' // Combine results!
})
```

## 3. Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)

How does Orama decide if a "Keyword match" is better than a "Vector match"?

- It uses an algorithm called **RRF**.
- RRF looks at the rank of a result in both lists and assigns a final combined score.
- This ensures that if a document is a good match for **both**, it goes straight to #1.

## Real-World Example: Medical Records

A doctor searches for "Type 2 Diabetes meds."

- **Keyword search** finds documents containing "Type 2" and "Diabetes."
- **Vector search** finds documents about "Metformin" or "Insulin Resistance" (which are related concepts).
- **Hybrid search** puts everything together, ensuring the doctor sees the most comprehensive list of information.

## Hypothetical Scenario: The "Niche Product"

A user searches for "Bose QuietComfort 45."

- **Vector search** might return generic "Noise-canceling headphones."
- **Keyword search** finds the exact Bose model.
- Because it's a Hybrid search, the exact Bose model appears first, but the similar headphones are shown right below as "Alternative options."

## Exercises

1. **Comparison:** When is Keyword search better than Vector search?
2. **Algorithm:** What is the name of the algorithm Orama uses to combine scores?
3. **Application:** Write a hybrid search query for an app that searches for "Tesla Model 3" using both text and vectors.

## Summary and Next Steps

Hybrid search is the industry standard for high-performance apps.
