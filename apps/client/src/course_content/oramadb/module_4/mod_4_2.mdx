# The Vector Schema

To use Vector Search in Orama, you must explicitly define which fields will contain embeddings and how "large" those embeddings are.

---

## 1. Defining the `vector` type

You add a field to your schema with the type `vector`. You must also provide the **Dimensions** (the length of the number list).

```javascript
const db = await create({
  schema: {
    title: 'string',
    embedding: 'vector[1536]', // OpenAI embeddings are usually 1536 long
  },
})
```

---

## 2. Searching with Vectors

When you search, instead of providing a `term` (string), you provide a `vector` (list of numbers).

```javascript
const result = await search(db, {
  mode: 'vector',
  vector: {
    value: [0.1, 0.2, ...], // Your search term converted to a vector
    property: 'embedding'
  },
  similarity: 0.85 // How "close" of a match do you want? (0.0 to 1.0)
})
```

---

## 3. Dimensions Matter

The dimension size must **exactly match** the output of the AI model you are using.

- If you use OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small`, use `1536`.
- If you use a local model like HuggingFace `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, it might be `384`.

---

## Real-World Example: Image Search

You can even search images with Orama!

- You use an AI model (like CLIP) to turn an image of a **"Red Apple"** into a vector.
- You store that vector in Orama.
- When a user uploads a photo of a red fruit, Orama compares the vectors and finds your "Red Apple" product.

---

## Hypothetical Scenario: The "Dimension Mismatch"

A developer tries to insert a vector of length 10 into a schema defined for length 1536.

- **Result:** Orama will throw an error.
- You must ensure your "Ingestion" script and your "Search" script are using the same AI model.

## Exercises

1. **Setup:** If you use a model that outputs vectors of length 512, how do you define the schema?
2. **Parameters:** What does "Similarity" mean in a vector search?
3. **Logic:** Can you use the same Orama index for both text search and vector search? (Hint: See the next lesson!)

## Summary and Next Steps

Vector schemas allow Orama to store AI-generated knowledge.

Next, we look at the "Holy Grail" of modern search: **Hybrid Search.**
