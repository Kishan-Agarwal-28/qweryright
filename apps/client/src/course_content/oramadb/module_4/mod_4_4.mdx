# RAG: Powering AI Chatbots

Retrieval Augmented Generation (**RAG**) is the process of giving an AI (like ChatGPT) access to your private data. OramaDB is the perfect engine for the "Retrieval" step.

## 1. The RAG Workflow

1. **User asks a question:** "What is the return policy for electronics?"
2. **Search (Retrieval):** Orama searches your database for the "Return Policy" documents.
3. **Context:** You take the text Orama finds and "glue" it to the user's question.
4. **Generation:** You send the combined package to an LLM: _"Based on this text [Policy Data], answer the user's question: [User Question]."_

## 2. Why Orama for RAG?

Most RAG systems are slow because they query a cloud database.

- Because Orama is **In-Memory** and can run on the **Edge**, the "Retrieval" step happens in milliseconds.
- This makes your chatbot feel much more responsive and "alive."

## 3. Summarization and Proximity

When doing RAG, you don't always need the _entire_ document. Orama helps you find the specific **Paragraphs** or "Chunks" that are most relevant to the question.

## Real-World Example: Customer Support Bot

An airline has 10,000 pages of travel regulations.

- A user asks: "Can I bring a cat on a flight to London?"
- Orama performs a **Hybrid Search** and finds 3 paragraphs about "Pet Travel" and "United Kingdom."
- These 3 paragraphs are sent to ChatGPT.
- ChatGPT answers: "Yes, but you need a health certificate and a specific carrier size."
- **Result:** The user gets an accurate answer based _only_ on the airline's official rules.

## Hypothetical Scenario: The "Hallucination" Fix

An AI says a product costs $10 when it actually costs $50.

- **The Solution:** By using RAG with Orama, the AI is forced to look at the _actual_ product data first.
- If Orama says the price is $50, the AI will report $50. This prevents the AI from "making things up" (hallucinating).

## Exercises

1. **Steps:** What are the four steps of the RAG workflow?
2. **Benefits:** Why does Orama's "In-Memory" nature help with RAG?
3. **Prevention:** How does RAG prevent AI hallucinations?

## Summary and Next Steps

RAG is the "Killer App" for vector databases.
