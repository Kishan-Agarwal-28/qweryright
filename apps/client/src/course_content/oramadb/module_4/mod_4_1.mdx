# What is Vector Search?

Traditional search looks for **Keywords**. If you search for "Liquid," it looks for that exact word. **Vector Search** looks for **Meanings**.

## 1. Embeddings: Turning Words into Numbers

To do vector search, we convert text into a list of numbers (a "Vector") using an AI model (like OpenAI).

- **"Liquid"** might become `[0.12, -0.45, 0.89, ...]`
- **"Water"** might become `[0.11, -0.44, 0.88, ...]`

Because the numbers are so similar, a mathematical calculation can prove that "Liquid" and "Water" have similar meanings.

## 2. Why Use It?

Vector search solves the "Synonym" problem.

- A user searches for **"cheap phones."**
- A traditional search might miss an article titled **"Inexpensive smartphones."**
- Vector search understands they are the same concept and shows both results.

## 3. Orama's Role

Orama includes a built-in **Vector Engine**. It stores these lists of numbers and performs the mathematical comparisons (Cosine Similarity) at lightning speed.

## Real-World Example: The Support Chatbot

A customer types: "How do I get my money back?"

- Traditional Search: Looks for "money", "back", "get".
- **Vector Search:** Understands the user is asking about a **"Refund Policy."**
- Orama finds the "Refund Policy" document even if the words "money" or "back" aren't in the title.

## Hypothetical Scenario: The "Empty Results" Rescue

A user searches for "Couch" on a furniture site.

- The site only uses the word "Sofa" in its database.
- **Traditional Search:** "Sorry, 0 results found."
- **Vector Search with Orama:** "Here are our Sofas!"
- The user buys a sofa, and the business saves a sale.

## Exercises

1. **Concepts:** What is an "Embedding"?
2. **Comparison:** How is Vector Search different from Keyword Search?
3. **Logic:** Why is Vector Search harder to set up than Keyword Search? (Hint: Do you need an extra AI model?)

## Summary and Next Steps

Vector search allows your app to "Understand" your user.

In the next lesson, we’ll see how to add **Vectors to our Orama Schema**.
