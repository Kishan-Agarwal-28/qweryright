# Module 4 - Summary

In this module, we entered the world of semantic search and AI.

---

## What we covered:

- **Vector Search:** Understanding how "Embeddings" represent meanings as numbers.
- **Vector Schemas:** How to define dimensions in Orama (e.g., 1536 for OpenAI).
- **Hybrid Search:** Combining the precision of keywords with the "gut feeling" of vectors.
- **RAG:** Using Orama as the memory for AI models to prevent hallucinations and provide accurate answers.

---

## Key Takeaway

Vector search doesn't replace keyword search; it supplements it. By using **Hybrid Search** with Orama, you can build applications that handle everything from exact part-number searches to abstract conceptual questions.

## Up Next: Module 5 - Orama Cloud & Deployment

You've built and queried your index locally. Now, how do you manage it in production? In the next module, we'll look at **Orama Cloud**, **Persistence**, and **Edge Deployment**.
