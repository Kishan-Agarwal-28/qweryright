# Implementing FULL JOINs (FULL OUTER JOIN)

We have seen `INNER JOIN` (matches only), `LEFT JOIN` (all left + matches), and `RIGHT JOIN` (all right + matches). The final join type is the `FULL JOIN` (or `FULL OUTER JOIN`).

The `FULL JOIN` is the "inclusive" join. It returns **everything**.

1.  It returns all matching rows.
2.  It returns all rows from the Left table (with NULLs on the right).
3.  It returns all rows from the Right table (with NULLs on the left).

## Understanding FULL JOIN

Think of `FULL JOIN` as a combination of a Left Join and a Right Join. It ensures that no data from _either_ table is left behind.

### Basic Syntax

```sql
SELECT table1.column_name, table2.column_name
FROM table1
FULL JOIN table2
ON table1.common_column = table2.common_column;
```

_Note: MySQL does not support the `FULL JOIN` keyword directly (you have to simulate it with `UNION`). However, PostgreSQL supports it natively, which is what we are using._

## Practical Examples and Demonstrations

Let's apply this to our **Online Bookstore**.

### Scenario 1: The Ultimate Audit (Customers vs. Orders)

We want a complete list of all customers and all orders.

- We want to see customers who bought things (Matches).
- We want to see customers who bought nothing (Left side).
- We want to see orders that have no valid customer attached (Right side - Orphaned data).

**Query:**

```sql
SELECT customers.name, orders.order_id
FROM customers
FULL JOIN orders
ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;
```

**Result:**
| name | order_id | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Alice | 1001 | Match (Normal) |
| Bob | NULL | Customer with no order |
| NULL | 1099 | Order with no customer (Data Error!) |

**Insight:**
This is incredibly useful for data quality checks. The rows with `NULL` on the left indicate serious database integrity issues (orders existing without a customer).

### Scenario 2: Merging Employee Lists

Imagine we have two tables: `Day_Shift_Employees` and `Night_Shift_Employees`. Some employees work both shifts. We want a master list of everyone.

**Query:**

```sql
SELECT day.name, night.name
FROM day_shift_employees AS day
FULL JOIN night_shift_employees AS night
ON day.employee_id = night.employee_id;
```

## Exercises and Practice Activities

To solidify your understanding, complete the following exercises.

### Exercise 1: The Full Inventory

Write a query to `FULL JOIN` the `Books` table and the `Sales_Promotions` table.

- This will show books that are on promotion.
- Books that are NOT on promotion.
- Promotions that have no books assigned to them yet.

### Exercise 2: Identifying Mismatches

Explain in your own words what it means if a `FULL JOIN` returns a row where the Left ID is `NULL` but the Right ID is `500`.

## Concluding Thoughts

In this lesson, we completed our tour of SQL Joins.

- **INNER:** Intersection (A ∩ B)
- **LEFT:** Left Circle (A)
- **RIGHT:** Right Circle (B)
- **FULL:** Union (A ∪ B)

In the final lesson of Module 4, we will step away from Joins and look at another way to combine data: **Subqueries**. These allow us to nest one query inside another to answer multi-step questions like "Who is the customer who spent more than the average?"
