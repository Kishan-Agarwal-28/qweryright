# Performing INNER JOINs for Matching Records

The `INNER JOIN` is the most frequently used join type in SQL. It is the default "strict" join. When you ask for an INNER JOIN between two tables, you are saying: "Show me only the records that link up perfectly. If a record in Table A doesn't have a match in Table B, hide it."

## Understanding INNER JOIN

Imagine a Venn diagram with two overlapping circles. The `INNER JOIN` represents the shaded area in the middle where the circles overlap. It filters out any data that is "orphaned" or unconnected.

### Basic Syntax

```sql
SELECT table1.column_name, table2.column_name
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1.common_column = table2.common_column;
```

- **`FROM table1`**: The first table (the "Left" table).
- **`INNER JOIN table2`**: The second table (the "Right" table).
- **`ON ...`**: The condition that links them. Usually, this is `Primary Key = Foreign Key`.

## Practical Examples and Demonstrations

Let's apply this to our **Online Bookstore**.

### Scenario 1: Books and Authors

We want to see a list of Book Titles alongside the Name of the Author who wrote them.

- `Books` table has `title` and `author_id`.
- `Authors` table has `author_id` and `name`.

**Query:**

```sql
SELECT books.title, authors.name
FROM books
INNER JOIN authors
ON books.author_id = authors.author_id;
```

**Result:**

- "1984" (ID 101) matches "George Orwell" (ID 101). -> **Returned.**
- "Harry Potter" (ID 102) matches "J.K. Rowling" (ID 102). -> **Returned.**
- _Edge Case:_ If we have a book with `author_id = NULL` (Anonymous), it is **NOT** returned.
- _Edge Case:_ If we have an author in the `Authors` table who hasn't written a book yet, they are **NOT** returned.

### Scenario 2: Orders and Customers

We want to see a list of Order IDs and the name of the customer who placed them.

**Query:**

```sql
SELECT orders.order_id, customers.name, orders.total_amount
FROM orders
INNER JOIN customers
ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id;
```

### Scenario 3: Handling Ambiguous Columns

What if both tables have a column named `created_at`? If you just type `SELECT created_at`, SQL will throw an error: "Ambiguous column name." You must specify which table you mean.

**Correct Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT orders.order_id, customers.created_at AS customer_joined_date
FROM orders
INNER JOIN customers
ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id;
```

### Scenario 4: Joining Three Tables

We can chain joins together. Let's list Book Titles, Author Names, and the Publisher Name.

**Query:**

```sql
SELECT books.title, authors.name, publishers.company_name
FROM books
INNER JOIN authors ON books.author_id = authors.author_id
INNER JOIN publishers ON books.publisher_id = publishers.publisher_id;
```

## Exercises and Practice Activities

To solidify your understanding of `INNER JOIN`, complete the following exercises.

### Exercise 1: The Basic Link

Write a query to join `Orders` and `Customers`. Select the `order_date` and the customer's `email`.

### Exercise 2: Filtering Joins

Write a query to join `Books` and `Authors`. Select the `title` and author `name`, but ONLY for books that cost more than $20. (Hint: Add a `WHERE` clause at the end).

### Exercise 3: The Missing Data

If you run an INNER JOIN between `Books` and `Authors`, and a specific book does not appear in the results, what are two possible reasons why?

## Concluding Thoughts

In this lesson, we learned how to use `INNER JOIN` to connect related data. This is the workhorse of SQL querying. It allows us to reconstruct complete records from our fragmented, normalized tables.

However, sometimes "strict" is too strict. What if we want to see _all_ books, even the ones without authors? Or _all_ customers, even those who haven't placed an order? For that, we need the `LEFT JOIN`, which we will explore in the next lesson.
