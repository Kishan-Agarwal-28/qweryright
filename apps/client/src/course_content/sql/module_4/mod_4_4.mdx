# Performing RIGHT JOINs (RIGHT OUTER JOIN)

The `RIGHT JOIN` (or `RIGHT OUTER JOIN`) is the exact opposite of the `LEFT JOIN`. Instead of prioritizing the first (left) table, it prioritizes the second (right) table.

It returns **all rows from the Right table**, and the matching rows from the Left table. If there is no match in the Left table, the result will contain `NULL`s on the left side.

## Understanding RIGHT JOIN

### Basic Syntax

```sql
SELECT table1.column_name, table2.column_name
FROM table1 -- LEFT table
RIGHT JOIN table2 -- RIGHT table (Priority)
ON table1.common_column = table2.common_column;
```

## Practical Examples and Demonstrations

Let's revisit the "Customers and Orders" scenario from the previous lesson, but flip it.

### Scenario 1: All Orders and Their Customers

We want to list every single order in our system. We also want to see the customer name.

**Query:**

```sql
SELECT customers.name, orders.order_id
FROM customers
RIGHT JOIN orders
ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;
```

**Analysis:**

- This query says: "Give me **every** row from `Orders`. If you can find a matching `Customer`, show their name. If not (maybe the customer was deleted?), show `NULL` for the name."
- In a well-designed database with Foreign Key constraints, every order _should_ have a customer, so this might behave like an INNER JOIN. But if data integrity is broken, this reveals "Orphaned Orders."

## Why RIGHT JOIN is Rarely Used

You might notice that `RIGHT JOIN table A ON ...` produces the exact same result as `LEFT JOIN table B ON ...` if you just swap the order of the tables in your query.

**Example:**
These two queries are identical in output:

1.  `SELECT * FROM Customers RIGHT JOIN Orders ...`
2.  `SELECT * FROM Orders LEFT JOIN Customers ...`

Because we read from left to right (and top to bottom), most developers find it cognitively easier to think in terms of "Start with the main table, then Left Join other things to it." Using `RIGHT JOIN` forces you to think backwards ("I want everything from the table I haven't typed yet...").

Therefore, the industry standard best practice is: **Stick to LEFT JOIN.** If you find yourself needing a RIGHT JOIN, just flip the table order and use a LEFT JOIN instead. It makes your code more readable for others.

## Exercises and Practice Activities

To solidify your understanding, complete the following exercises.

### Exercise 1: The Flip

Rewrite the following query using a `LEFT JOIN` so that it produces the exact same result:

```sql
SELECT authors.name, books.title
FROM books
RIGHT JOIN authors
ON books.author_id = authors.author_id;
```

### Exercise 2: Orphaned Records

Write a `RIGHT JOIN` query between `Books` (Left) and `Order_Items` (Right). This will list every item ever ordered. If a book has been deleted from the database but the order record remains, the book title will be NULL.

## Concluding Thoughts

In this lesson, we covered the `RIGHT JOIN`. While it is a valid SQL command, it is largely a stylistic alternative to `LEFT JOIN`. We learned that for readability and consistency, `LEFT JOIN` is generally preferred.

In the next lesson, we will look at the `FULL JOIN`, which combines the power of both Left and Right joins to show absolutely everything.
