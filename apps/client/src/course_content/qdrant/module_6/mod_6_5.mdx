# Module 6 - Summary

In this module, we looked at the "Power Couple" of AI: **LLMs + Qdrant.**

---

## What we covered:

- **RAG:** Retrieval Augmented Generation (Retrieving facts before generating answers).
- **Chunking:** Splitting big data into small, vector-ready pieces.
- **Context Injection:** Feeding Qdrant results into an LLM prompt.
- **Trust:** Using score thresholds and metadata to stop hallucinations.

---

## Key Takeaway

Qdrant is the **Long-Term Memory** for AI. It allows chatbots to be "Knowledgeable" about your specific business, your specific code, or your specific private data without and expensive "Training" phase.

## Up Next: Module 7 - Final Project: Semantic Search Engine

It’s time to build! In our final module, we'll put everything together to design a **Semantic Search Engine** for a hypothetical Digital Library.
