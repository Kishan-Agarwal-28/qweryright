# Preventing Hallucinations

Hallucinations happen when an LLM gets "Creative" because it doesn't have enough facts. Qdrant is the "Fact Engine."

## 1. Score Thresholding

If a user asks about "Zombies," but your corporate database contains zero information about zombies, Qdrant will still return the "nearest" neighbor (maybe a document about "Infectious Diseases").
The LLM might then try to link corporate policy to zombies.

**The Fix:**
Set a `score_threshold: 0.8`. If Qdrant returns nothing (because the topic is not in your data), the app should tell the user: _"Sorry, I don't have information on that topic in my records."_

## 2. Source Attribution

Always include the **Payload** data in your final answer.
Don't just give an answer—give the source!

_"Based on the **Employee Handbook (page 12)**, the policy is..."_

Because Qdrant stores the filename and page number in the Payload, your app can verify exactly where the information came from.

## Real-World Example: Medical AI

A doctor uses an AI to check drug side effects.

- **Bad AI:** "I think this drug causes headaches."
- **Qdrant-Powered AI:** "According to the **FDA Registry (Document #992)**, this drug causes headaches in 2% of patients."

The second one is trustworthy because it is grounded in a specific "Point" in Qdrant.

## Quick Exercises:

1. **The Threshold**: If the similarity score is 0.2, is the information likely to be relevant?
2. **Metadata**: What kind of data should you store in the Qdrant Payload to make your RAG bot more trustworthy? (e.g., URL, Author, Date).
3. **Draft**: Why is "Source Attribution" more important for a Lawyer than for someone searching for Movie Recommendations?
