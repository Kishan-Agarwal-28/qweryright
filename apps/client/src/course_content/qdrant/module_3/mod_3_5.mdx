# Module 3 - Summary

In this module, we mastered the "Measurement" of meaning.

---

## What we covered:

- **Cosine Similarity:** Best for text. Focuses on the **Angle** (Intent).
- **Euclidean Distance:** Best for images and face-rec. Focuses on **Precision** (Exact Values).
- **Dot Product:** Best for recommendations. Focuses on both **Direction** and **Intensity**.

---

## Key Takeaway

Choosing the right distance metric is a "Physics" decision for your data.

- **Text?** Use Cosine.
- **Photos?** Use Euclidean.
- **Social Media Feeds?** Use Dot Product.

## Up Next: Module 4 - Searching & Filtering

Now that we can measure distance, let's learn how to do it **Fast**. In the next module, we'll explore **HNSW** (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) indexes—the secret to searching 1 billion items in 50 milliseconds.
