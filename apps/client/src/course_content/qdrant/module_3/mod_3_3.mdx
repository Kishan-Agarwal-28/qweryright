# Euclidean Distance (L2)

Euclidean distance is the classic "Straight Line" distance between two points. It is the same formula you learned in high school geometry.

## The "Ruler" Math

If you have two points (A and B), Euclidean distance calculates the length of the string required to connect them directly.

**When to use it:**

- **Image Search:** Often images are processed into vectors where the _exact_ values matter.
- **Audio Fingerprinting:** Comparing sound waves.
- **Physical Coordinates:** If your vectors actually represent X/Y positions on a map or 3D model.

## Real-World Example: Face Recognition

Face recognition software converts features (distance between eyes, width of nose) into numbers.
If Person A has a nose width of `5.0` and Person B has a nose width of `5.1`, Euclidean distance will record that tiny difference.

Unlike Cosine (which looks at trends/angles), Euclidean cares about **Precision.**

## Hypothetical Scenario: The "Mistaken Identity"

A developer uses Euclidean distance for Document Search.

- **Doc 1:** "Shoes are great."
- **Doc 2:** "Shoes are great. I love shoes. Shoes are my life. I have 500 shoes."

Even though both docs are about shoes, Doc 2 is "Much farther away" from the center of the graph because it mentions it so many times. Euclidean might think these docs are **different**, whereas Cosine would know they are **the same**.

## Quick Exercises:

1. **The Formula**: What shape is formed if we measure the Euclidean distance between two points in 2D space? (Hint: Think of a triangle).
2. **Best for...**: Would you use Euclidean for comparing _Long Books_ or for comparing _Fingerprints_?
3. **Difference**: In your own words, why does "Size" matter for Euclidean but not for Cosine?
