# Normalization & Scaling

Before we dive into the Qdrant API, we need to understand one final math concept: **Normalization.**

## Size Doesn't Always Matter

Imagine two vectors:

- **Vector A:** `[1, 1]` (Represents a short review: "Great!")
- **Vector B:** `[10, 10]` (Represents a long review: "Great great great great...")

In some math systems, Vector B would be 10x "Stronger" than Vector A. But in search, they mean exactly the same thing!

## What is Normalization?

Normalization "squashes" vectors so they have a length of **1.0**.

- Vector A becomes: `[0.707, 0.707]`
- Vector B becomes: `[0.707, 0.707]`

Now they are identical! Qdrant prefers normalized vectors for most operations because it makes "Distance" calculations much faster and more accurate.

## Real-World Example: Image Search

When searching for "A cat," you don't want the search to fail just because one image is **4K resolution** and the other is a **low-res thumbnail**.
Normalization ensures the _Content_ of the image (the "Cat-ness") is what matters, not the _Size_ of the file.

## Quick Exercises:

1. **Definition**: What does "Normalization" do to a vector's length?
2. **Logic**: If two vectors point in the same direction but one is twice as long as the other, are they geometrically "Similar"?
3. **Draft**: If you have a vector `[0, 5]`, what would the normalized version be? (Hint: The coordinates should add up in a way that the length is 1).
