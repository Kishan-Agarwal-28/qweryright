# Dimensions & Vector Space

We often talk about vectors having "Dimensions." This is just the size of the list of numbers.

## What are Dimensions?

- **2D Vector:** `[1.2, 3.4]` (A point on a map: X and Y).
- **3D Vector:** `[1.2, 3.4, 5.5]` (A point in a room: X, Y, and Z).
- **LLM Vector:** `[0.1, 0.4, ... 1536 times]` (Modern AI models like GPT-4 use 1536 dimensions!).

Each "Dimension" represents a specific trait or feature.

- Dimension 1 might represent "Salty vs Sweet".
- Dimension 2 might represent "Hot vs Cold".
- Dimension 3 might represent "Solid vs Liquid".

## Real-World Example: The "Food Map"

Imagine we model foods in 2D Space:

- **Ice Cream**: `[0.1 (Salty), 0.9 (Sweet)]`
- **Brownie**: `[0.15 (Salty), 0.85 (Sweet)]`
- **Potato Chip**: `[0.9 (Salty), 0.1 (Sweet)]`

In our **Vector Space**, the Ice Cream and Brownie are very close to each other. The Potato Chip is far away.

## The "Curse" of Dimensionality

When you have 1,536 dimensions, humans cannot visualize it. But the math stays the same. Qdrant is built to handle this "High Dimensional" math efficiently without slowing down.

## Quick Exercises:

1. **Count**: How many dimensions are in the vector `[0.1, 0.5, 0.2, 0.9, 0.4]`?
2. **Visualization**: Why can't we draw a 1536-dimensional vector on a whiteboard?
3. **Similarity**: If a vector has 100 dimensions, and 99 of them match perfectly, but one is completely different, are the items still "Similar"?
