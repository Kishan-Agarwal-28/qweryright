# Module 1 - Summary

In this module, we explored the "Brain" of modern AI search.

---

## What we covered:

- **Vectors:** Lists of numbers that represent the "Meaning" of data.
- **Embeddings:** The process of turning text/images into vectors using AI models.
- **Dimensions:** The traits or features that define a vector's "Meaning."
- **Normalization:** Making vectors comparable regardless of their original scale.

---

## Key Takeaway

Vector databases allow us to search for **Intent** rather than **Matches**. This is the foundation of every recommendation system, image search tool, and AI chatbot in existence today.

## Up Next: Module 2 - Qdrant Architecture

Now that we have the math, let's look at the **Storage**. In the next module, we'll learn about **Collections**, **Points**, and how Qdrant stores metadata alongside vectors in **Payloads**.
