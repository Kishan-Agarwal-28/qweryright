# Recommendations & Discovery

Qdrant has special APIs that go beyond just "Nearest Neighbor." You can find items based on **"Examples."**

---

## 1. Recommendation API

Instead of a vector, you provide a list of **Positive** and **Negative** IDs.

- _"I like the vectors for ID:1 and ID:2, but I HATE the vector for ID:10."_

Qdrant will calculate a "Sweet Spot" in the middle of your likes, far away from your dislikes, and find results there.

```javascript
await client.recommend('products', {
  positive: [1, 2],
  negative: [10],
  limit: 5,
})
```

## 2. Discovery API

Discovery is used when you want to find items that are similar to "Target A" but also close to "Target B."
It’s like saying: _"Find me a car that has the style of a Ferrari but the price tag of a Toyota."_

## Real-World Example: "Pandora" Style Radio

1. Start with a song you like (Positive).
2. Every time you "Skip" a song, the app adds it to the **Negative** list.
3. Every time you "Like" a song, it adds it to the **Positive** list.
4. The next song is chosen via the `recommend` API. The radio gets smarter with every click!

## Quick Exercises:

1. **The Difference**: How is `recommend` different from a standard `search`?
2. **Dislike**: Why is the `negative` list important for a recommendation engine? (What happens if you only have a positive list?)
3. **Scenario**: You are building a Tinder-style app for Fashion. If a user swipes "Left" on a shirt, which Qdrant parameter should you update?
   lighthouse.
