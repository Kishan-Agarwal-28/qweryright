# The Search API: Finding "Top K"

When you query Qdrant, you are performing a **k-NN** (k-Nearest Neighbors) search.

---

## What is "Top K"?

In search terminology, **"K"** is the number of results you want.
If you say "k=10," you are asking Qdrant: _"Find me the 10 points that are closest to my query vector."_

## A Typical Search Request (JavaScript)

Using the `@qdrant/js-client-rest` library:

```javascript
const response = await client.search("my_collection", {
    vector: [0.2, 0.1, 0.9, ...], // Your search vector
    limit: 5,                    // This is "K"
    with_payload: true,           // Return the metadata
    with_vector: false            // We don't need the numbers back
});

console.log(response);
```

## Real-World Example: "Similar Items"

When you see a "You might also like" section on a website, the backend is running a Qdrant search.

1. It takes the vector of the item you are currently looking at.
2. It sends that vector to Qdrant with `limit: 5`.
3. It displays the 5 results to you.

## Hypothetical Scenario: The "Nonsense Result"

A user searches for "Best running shoes" and the first 3 results are perfect. But results 8, 9, and 10 are about "Car tires."
**Why?** Because a k-NN search **always** returns K results, even if the distance is huge. If there are only 3 shoes in the database, Qdrant will simply find the next "closest" things, which might be completely unrelated.

**The Fix:** Use `score_threshold`. This tells Qdrant: _"Only return items if they have a similarity score higher than 0.8."_

## Quick Exercises:

1. **The Parameter**: Which property in the search request controls how many results are returned?
2. **The Threshold**: If your `score_threshold` is too high (e.g., 0.999), what will happen to your search results?
3. **Draft**: Write a pseudocode search for "3 most similar songs" given a song vector.
