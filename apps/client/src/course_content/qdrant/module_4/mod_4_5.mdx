# Module 4 - Summary

In this module, we looked at how Qdrant actually performs searches.

---

## What we covered:

- **Search API:** Using "Top K" and "Score Thresholds" for accuracy.
- **HNSW:** The layered "Graph" index that makes vector search blazing fast.
- **Hybrid Search:** Combining mathematical "Meaning" with hard "Filters" (metadata).
- **Recommendations:** Using "Positives" and "Negatives" to find the perfect match.

---

## Key Takeaway

Vector search is powerful because it is **flexible**. Whether you are looking for an exact match, a similar item, or a complex recommendation based on feedback, Qdrant provides a specific API to do it at scale.

## Up Next: Module 5 - Vector Search in Production

We can search, but how do we manage the database? In the next module, we'll learn about **Upserting** data, handling **Large Imports**, and how to monitor **Performance** (latency and memory).
