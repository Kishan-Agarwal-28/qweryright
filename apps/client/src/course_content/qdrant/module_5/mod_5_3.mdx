# Snapshots & Backups

A vector database is often a "Secondary" database. You might have the original text in Postgres and the vectors in Qdrant.
However, because generating vectors (Embeddings) is **expensive and slow**, you really don't want to lose your Qdrant data!

## What is a Snapshot?

A Snapshot is a single file that contains the entire state of a collection (Vectors, Payloads, and Indexes).

**Creating a Snapshot (API):**
`POST /collections/my_data/snapshots`

This returns a `.snapshot` file. You can download this file and store it in S3 or Google Cloud Storage.

## Restoring from a Snapshot

If your server crashes, you don't have to re-embed all your text. You simply tell Qdrant: _"Here is my snapshot file. Rebuild the collection from this."_

## Real-World Example: "Point-in-Time" Recovery

A company accidentally runs a script that deletes 50% of their "User Interest" vectors.
Using a Snapshot from 4 hours ago, they can restore the database in minutes.
Without it, they would have to call the OpenAI API 500,000 times to regenerate the vectors, costing them thousands of dollars in API fees.

## Quick Exercises:

1. **The File**: What is the file extension of a Qdrant backup?
2. **The "Why"**: Why is it more expensive to "re-build" a vector database compared to a standard SQL database? (Think about the Embedding Model fees).
3. **Best Practice**: How often should you take a snapshot for a database that updates every 5 minutes? (Daily, Hourly, or Every Minute?)
