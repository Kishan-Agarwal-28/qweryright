# Module 5 - Summary

In this module, we moved from "Code" to "Operation."

---

## What we covered:

- **Upserting:** Efficiently adding or updating data in batches.
- **RAM vs Disk:** Balancing speed and cost using "MMap" (Memory Mapping).
- **Snapshots:** Saving your hard work so you don't have to re-embed data.
- **Hosting:** Choosing between Docker (Self-hosted) and Qdrant Cloud (Managed).

---

## Key Takeaway

Running a vector database in production is a "Storage Math" game. By using batching, snapshots, and choosing the right hosting environment, you can scale from a tiny experiment to a massive enterprise search tool.

## Up Next: Module 6 - Advanced RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)

This is the most popular use for Qdrant today. In the next module, we'll learn how to connect Qdrant to LLMs (like GPT-4) to build chatbots that actually know your private data.
