# Hosting: Docker vs. Qdrant Cloud

Where should you actually run Qdrant?

---

## 1. Local / Docker (Self-Hosted)

This is the easiest way to start.

```bash
docker run -p 6333:6333 qdrant/qdrant
```

- **Pro:** Complete control. No cost (other than your server).
- **Con:** You have to handle your own backups, scaling, and security.

---

## 2. Qdrant Cloud (Managed)

This is a hosted version of Qdrant (SaaS).

- **Pro:** Click a button to scale. Automated backups. Built-in monitoring and dashboards. You only pay for what you use.
- **Con:** Recurring monthly cost.

## Real-World Example: Prototyping

When you are just building a "Side Project" or a Prototype, **Docker** is perfect. It runs on your laptop for free.
Once you have 10,000 users and you can't afford a single minute of "Downtime," you should move to **Qdrant Cloud**.

---

## Hypothetical Scenario: The "Sneaky Cost"

A developer self-hosts Qdrant on a tiny server with 2GB of RAM. They load 500,000 vectors.
The server runs out of memory and crashes. Because they didn't have "Auto-scaling," their app is offline for 12 hours while they sleep.

**Lesson:** Managed clouds are often worth the money because they notify you before your server dies!

## Quick Exercises:

1. **Command**: What is the standard Docker port for Qdrant?
2. **Comparison**: Give one reason to choose Self-Hosting over Managed Cloud.
3. **Logic**: If your app processes sensitive data that cannot leave your physical office, which hosting option must you use?
