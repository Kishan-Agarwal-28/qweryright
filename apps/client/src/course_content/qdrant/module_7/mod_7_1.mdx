# Final Project: The Digital Library

We are going to build a **Semantic Search Engine** for a library of Technical Books.

---

## The Goal

A user should be able to search for concepts like _"How to scale a database?"_ and find books on Sharding, Replication, and Performance, even if those books don't use the exact words "scale" in the title.

---

## The Tech Stack

1. **Database:** Qdrant (for vector and metadata storage).
2. **Embedder:** OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small` (or any model you choose).
3. **Data:** A list of book snippets.

---

## The Data Model (Payload)

Every "Point" in our Qdrant collection will look like this:

```json
{
  "id": "A UUID",
  "vector": "[1536 numbers]",
  "payload": {
    "title": "Designing Data-Intensive Applications",
    "author": "Martin Kleppmann",
    "category": "Architecture",
    "text_snippet": "Replication means keeping a copy of the same data on multiple machines..."
  }
}
```

## Project Step 1: Planning

Before writing code, answer these questions:

1. **Distance Metric:** Will you use Cosine, Euclidean, or Dot Product? (Review Module 3).
2. **Collection Name:** What will you name your collection?
3. **Chunking:** Will you store the whole book in one vector, or split it into chapters?

---

## Quick Exercises:

1. **Selection**: Why is "Architecture" a good metadata field to store in the Payload? (How could we use it for filtering?)
2. **Logic**: If we have two books by the same author, do they have the same vector?
3. **Design**: In a real app, would you store the _Full Text_ of the book in Qdrant, or just a _Summary_? Why?
   orchard.
