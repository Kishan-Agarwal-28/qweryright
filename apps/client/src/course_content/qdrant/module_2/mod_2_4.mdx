# Named Vectors: Multimodal Data

What if a single object has _multiple_ representations? For example, a "Product" has a **Description** (Text) and a **Photo** (Image).

---

## The Old Way

You would create two separate collections: `product_descriptions` and `product_images`. This makes it very hard to keep your data in sync.

## The Qdrant Way: Named Vectors

A single **Point** can have multiple vectors, each with a different name and size.

```json
PUT /collections/products
{
    "vectors": {
        "text_vector": { "size": 1536, "distance": "Cosine" },
        "image_vector": { "size": 512, "distance": "Euclidean" }
    }
}
```

Now, when you "Upsert" a product, you give it both lists of numbers. When you "Search," you tell Qdrant which vector you want to use.

---

## Real-World Example: Linked Search

- **Search A:** Find products that "Sound" like this description. (Search using `text_vector`).
- **Search B:** Find products that "Look" like this photo. (Search using `image_vector`).

All the metadata (Price, Name, ID) stays in the same place! This is called **Multimodal Search**.

## Quick Exercises:

1. **Capacity**: How many vectors can a single Point have? (One or Multiple?)
2. **Benefit**: Why is it better to have named vectors in one point instead of two separate collections?
3. **Scenario**: If you were building a Music Search engine, what two "Named Vectors" might you store for a song? (e.g., Lyrics and ...?).
   clearing.
