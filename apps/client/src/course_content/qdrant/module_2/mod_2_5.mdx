# Module 2 - Summary

In this module, we looked under the hood of Qdrant.

---

## What we covered:

- **Points:** The atom of Qdrant (ID + Vector + Payload).
- **IDs:** Using Integers or UUIDs to sync with outside databases.
- **Collections:** The "Table" where points of the same size live.
- **Payloads:** JSON metadata that allows for filtering by facts (Price, Color, Date).
- **Named Vectors:** Storing multiple "Meanings" (Text, Image, Audio) for a single object.

---

## Key Takeaway

A Vector Database isn't just a pile of numbers. By combining **Vectors** (Meaning) with **Payloads** (Metadata), you can build search tools that are both "Smart" and "Precise."

## Up Next: Module 3 - Distance Metrics

We have the points stored. But how does Qdrant decide which point is "Closest"? In the next module, we'll learn about **Cosine Similarity**, **Euclidean Distance**, and how to choose the right math for your project.
