# Points & IDs

In Qdrant, the basic unit of data is called a **Point**.

---

## What is a Point?

A Point is the combination of:

1. **ID:** A unique identifier (Number or UUID).
2. **Vector:** The list of numbers (The "Meaning").
3. **Payload:** Optional metadata (The "JSON").

## The ID

Unlike MongoDB which uses `_id` strings, Qdrant allows two types of IDs:

- **64-bit Integers:** `12345` (Very fast).
- **UUIDs:** `e877080a-5b12-42b7-8984-63c87e500851` (Great for syncing with other databases like SQL).

---

## Real-World Example: Syncing with SQL

Imagine you have a `users` table in Postgres with IDs like `101, 102, 103`.
When you create vectors for these users, you should use the **same ID** in Qdrant.

When Qdrant finds a match for "User 102," you can instantly reach back into Postgres to get their email address or profile picture using that same ID.

## Hypothetical Scenario: The "Identity Crisis"

A developer generates IDs for Qdrant randomly. They find a great match: `ID: 98721`.
But there is NO way to know which product that belongs to in the main database! They have to perform a slow "Scan" of the metadata to find out.

**Pro-tip:** Always keep your IDs consistent across your primary database and your vector database.

## Quick Exercises:

1. **The Trio**: List the three components of a Qdrant "Point."
2. **Type check**: Which ID type is better if you want your IDs to be globally unique across multiple servers?
3. **Logic**: Can a single Point have more than one vector attached to it? (Research needed, or wait for the "Named Vectors" lesson!).
