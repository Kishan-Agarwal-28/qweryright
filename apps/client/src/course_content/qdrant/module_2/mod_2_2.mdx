# Collections: The Container

In SQL, you have "Tables." In MongoDB, you have "Collections." In Qdrant, you also have **Collections**.

## What is a Collection?

A Collection is a named set of points. Every point in a collection **must** have the same vector size.

**Example:**

- `movies` collection: Vectors must be size **1536**.
- `audio_clips` collection: Vectors must be size **512**.

You cannot mix different vector sizes in the same collection.

## Real-World Example: Multi-tenant Apps

If you are building an app for different companies (Company A and Company B), you should create **Separate Collections** for each.
This ensures that Company A never accidentally searches through Company B's private data.

## Setting up a Collection (HTTP API)

To create a collection, you tell Qdrant the "Shape" of the data:

```json
PUT /collections/products
{
    "vectors": {
        "size": 1536,
        "distance": "Cosine"
    }
}
```

- **Size:** How many numbers are in each list.
- **Distance:** How to calculate "Similarity" (We will cover this in Module 3!).

## Quick Exercises:

1. **Rule**: Why can't you put a 512-dimension vector into a 1536-dimension collection?
2. **Draft**: Write the JSON required to create a collection called "songs" with vectors of size 128.
3. **Hierarchy**: In the hierarchy of data, where does a "Point" sit relative to a "Collection"?
   ridge.
