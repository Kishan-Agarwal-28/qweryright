## Your Graph Cheat Sheet

| Feature         | Cypher Command                           | Purpose               |
| :-------------- | :--------------------------------------- | :-------------------- |
| **Create Node** | `CREATE (n:Label {key: 'val'})`          | Add data.             |
| **Connect**     | `MATCH (a), (b) CREATE (a)-[:TYPE]->(b)` | Add relationships.    |
| **Logic**       | `MERGE (n:User {id: 1})`                 | Create if not exists. |
| **Filter**      | `WHERE n.age > 21`                       | Refine results.       |
| **Stats**       | `RETURN count(*)`                        | Aggregation.          |
| **Algorithms**  | `CALL gds.pageRank.stream(...)`          | Graph Analysis.       |

## Final Wisdom

Graph Databases aren't a replacement for SQL or MongoDB—they are a specialized tool.

- Use **SQL** for structured tables and simple reporting.
- Use **MongoDB** for flexible documents.
- Use **Neo4j** when the **Relationships** between your data points are just as important as the data points themselves.

## What's Next?

Now that you understand the power of Graph Traversal, you are ready to explore **Vector Databases**.
Vector Databases (like **Qdrant**) take these concepts even further, allowing us to search for "Similarity" not just by shared nodes, but by the "Meaning" of text and images.

**Onward to Qdrant!**
island.
