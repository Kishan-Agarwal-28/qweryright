# Final Project: The Fraud Detection Lab

We are going to build a system to detect **Synthetic Identity Fraud**. This is when criminals share pieces of information (like a phone number or address) to create multiple "fake" people.

---

## The Scenario

You work for a bank. You have a list of applications. You suspect that some applicants are using the same phone number or credit card to open different accounts.

### Step 1: Create the Data

Run this script to set up our suspicious network:

```cypher
// Create Applicants
CREATE (a1:Applicant {name: "Alice Smith", id: "A1"})
CREATE (a2:Applicant {name: "Bob Jones", id: "A2"})
CREATE (a3:Applicant {name: "Charlie Brown", id: "A3"})
CREATE (a4:Applicant {name: "David Wilson", id: "A4"})

// Create Shared Resources
CREATE (p1:Phone {number: "555-0199"})
CREATE (e1:Email {address: "bob.j@example.com"})
CREATE (addr1:Address {street: "123 Maple St"})

// Connect them
CREATE (a1)-[:HAS_PHONE]->(p1)
CREATE (a2)-[:HAS_PHONE]->(p1) // Alice and Bob share a phone number!
CREATE (a2)-[:HAS_EMAIL]->(e1)
CREATE (a3)-[:HAS_EMAIL]->(e1) // Bob and Charlie share an email!
CREATE (a3)-[:HAS_ADDRESS]->(addr1)
CREATE (addr1)<-[:HAS_ADDRESS]-(a4)
```

## Real-World Insight

In a relational database (SQL), finding this "Social Chain" would require multiple `JOIN` statements. If the chain is 6 people long, the SQL query becomes unreadable and incredibly slow.
In Neo4j, it's just a simple path traversal.

---

## Project Task:

1. Copy the code block above into your Neo4j Browser and execute it.
2. Note how the visualization immediately shows clusters of connections.
3. Observe: Does David Wilson connect to Alice Smith? (Count the "hops" between them).

---

## Quick Exercises:

1. **Visualization**: Draw (on paper or mentally) the graph you just created.
2. **Relationships**: How many different _types_ of sharing are happening in this graph? (Phone, Email, Address).
3. **Intuition**: If you were a bank investigator, why would you be suspicious of "Charlie Brown"?
   forest.
