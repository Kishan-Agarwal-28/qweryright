# Intro to Graph Data Science (GDS)

A graph is more than just data storage; it is a mathematical structure. **Graph Data Science (GDS)** is the practice of running algorithms on the "Shape" of the graph to find hidden patterns.

## 1. What is the GDS Library?

GDS is a plugin for Neo4j that adds advanced algorithms. You don't use Cypher `MATCH` for these; you use specialized "Procedures" (e.g., `CALL gds.pageRank.stream(...)`).

## 2. The Three Steps of GDS

1. **Project the Graph:** GDS takes a "Copy" of your graph and stores it in RAM. This makes it thousands of times faster because it's optimized for math, not storage.
2. **Run the Algorithm:** You call the algorithm (e.g., "Find the most important nodes").
3. **Write Back or Stream:** You save the results back to the database or send them to your application.

## 3. Why GDS?

Traditional Cypher searches for **Patterns**. GDS searches for **Topology**.

- Cypher: "Find all users who follow Alice."
- GDS: "Find the most influential user in the entire network."

## Real-World Example: Infrastructure Stability

An electric company models its grid in Neo4j (Power Plants -> Substations -> Transformers).

- They use GDS to simulate a "Failure Point."
- If we delete "Substation A," how many houses lose power?
- It computes the "Critical Nodes" that, if broken, would cause the most damage to the system.

## Hypothetical Scenario: The "Influencer" Search

A marketing agency wants to give a free sample to the most "Connected" person in a city.

- They have a graph of 1 million people.
- **The Problem:** Simply having the most followers isn't enough—you need to follow someone who _also_ has many followers.
- **The Solution:** They run **PageRank** (the GDS algorithm Google uses).
- The result is a list of users who are the "true" centers of influence.

## Exercises

1. **Philosophy:** What is the difference between "Pattern Matching" and "Topology"?
2. **Process:** Why does GDS "Project" the graph into memory before running algorithms?
3. **Logic:** Name one algorithm you've heard of that works on graphs.

## Summary and Next Steps

GDS turns your database into a lab.

Next, we look at our first specific algorithm: **PageRank (Centrality).**
