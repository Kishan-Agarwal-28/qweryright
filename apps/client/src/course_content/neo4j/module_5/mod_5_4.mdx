# Similarity Algorithms

"Show me someone like Alice." **Similarity Algorithms** use the patterns of your relationships to calculate a "Score" between two nodes.

---

## 1. Node Similarity (Jaccard)

The Jaccard Similarity index compares the number of "Shared Neighbors" against the "Total Neighbors."

- **Example:** If User A and User B both follow 9 of the same 10 people, they are 90% similar.

---

## 2. Cosine Similarity

Used when your relationships have **Weights** (numbers).

- **Example:** User A rated "The Matrix" a 5, and "Titanic" a 1. User B gave them the exact same scores. They are perfectly similar in their tastes.

---

## 3. Creating "Knowledge" from Similarity

Once you find that two nodes are similar, you can draw a **new relationship** between them: `[:SIMILAR_TO]`. This is called **Graph Completion**.

## Real-World Example: "Users Also Liked..."

An e-commerce site uses GDS to find similar shoppers.

- Customer A buys `Flour`, `Sugar`, and `Eggs`.
- Customer B buys `Flour` and `Sugar`.
- The **Node Similarity** algorithm flags them as highly similar.
- The site then suggests `Eggs` to Customer B.

## Hypothetical Scenario: The "Movie Buddy"

A user is lonely and wants to find someone with the exact same taste in movies.

- **The Graph:** 1,000,000 users and 50,000 movies.
- **The Problem:** It's too much data for a manual search.
- **The Solution:** The developer runs **Cosine Similarity** on the "Movie Rating" weights.
- The algorithm ignores everyone who just likes "Popular" movies and finds the one person who also loves the same 3 obscure Japanese documentaries from the 1970s.

## Exercises

1. **Math:** If User A has 4 friends and User B has 4 friends, and they share 2 friends in common, what is their Jaccard Similarity? (Shared / Total distinct).
2. **Usage:** When should you use Cosine Similarity instead of Jaccard?
3. **Logic:** How does "Similarity" power a recommendation engine?

## Summary and Next Steps

Algorithms turn your data into intelligence.
