# Module 5 - Summary

In this module, we moved from "Querying" to "Analysis."

---

## What we covered:

- **GDS Projections:** How to move your graph data into high-speed memory for math.
- **Centrality (PageRank):** Finding the most influential nodes in a network.
- **Community Detection:** Finding clusters and "tribes" of nodes.
- **Similarity:** Comparing nodes based on their shared neighbors and weights.

---

## Key Takeaway

Graph Data Science allows you to **predict** and **recommend**. By understanding the _structure_ of your graph, you can find the "Most Important" people, the "Most Similar" products, and the "Hidden Clusters" of bad actors.

## Up Next: Module 6 - Neo4j in Production

We've mastered the math. Now let's look at the **Real World**. In the next module, we'll learn about connecting your code to Neo4j using **Drivers**, the **APOC Library**, and how to manage a database in the **Cloud (Neo4j Aura).**
