# PageRank (Centrality)

Who is the "Most Important" person in your graph? **PageRank** is the algorithm that answers that question.

## 1. How PageRank Works

PageRank (named after Larry Page of Google) measures the importance of nodes based on their connections.

- A node is important if it has many incoming relationships.
- A node is **even more important** if it has incoming relationships from _other_ important nodes.

## 2. Using it in Neo4j

```cypher
CALL gds.pageRank.stream('my-graph-projection')
YIELD nodeId, score
RETURN gds.util.asNode(nodeId).name AS name, score
ORDER BY score DESC
```

## 3. Other Centrality Algorithms

1. **Betweenness Centrality:** Finds nodes that act as "Bridges" between different parts of the graph. (Great for finding "Gatekeepers").
2. **Degree Centrality:** Just counts the number of relationships. (Simple but useful).

## Real-World Example: Search Engine Ranking

This is how Google started.

- Every Website is a **Node**.
- Every Link is a **Relationship**.
- If Wikipedia links to your blog, your "Score" goes up significantly because Wikipedia is a highly trusted (important) node.

## Hypothetical Scenario: The "Bridge" Employee

In a large company, there are two departments that rarely talk to each other (Engineering and Marketing).

- One employee, Sarah, works in Engineering but used to work in Marketing.
- **The Graph:** Most relationships are within groups. Sarah is the only relationship _between_ groups.
- If you run **Betweenness Centrality**, Sarah will have a massive score.
- **The Lesson:** If Sarah quits, the two departments will lose their connection entirely. Sarah is a "Critical Bridge."

## Exercises

1. **Theory:** If someone with a high PageRank score links to you, what happens to your score?
2. **Comparison:** How is "Betweenness" different from "PageRank"?
3. **Application:** Why would a transportation company use Betweenness Centrality to find "Bottlenecks" in their road network?

## Summary and Next Steps

Centrality helps you find the "Leaders" and "Bridges" in your data.

Next, we look at **Community Detection**—how to find groups of people who are tightly connected.
