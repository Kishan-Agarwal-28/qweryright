# Indexing for Performance

We learned that Neo4j is "Index-Free" once you are traversing. But to find the **starting point** of your search, you still need an Index.

## 1. Why do we need an Index?

If you have 10 million nodes and you say `MATCH (p:Person {name: "Alice"})`, Neo4j has to check every single `:Person` node to see if its name is Alice. This is a "Full Scan" and it's very slow.

- **The Solution:** Create an index on `Person(name)`.

## 2. Creating an Index

```cypher
CREATE INDEX FOR (p:Person) ON (p.name)
```

---

## 3. Types of Indexes in Neo4j

1. **Range Indexes:** For numbers and dates (e.g., `price < 100`).
2. **Text Indexes:** For string searches (e.g., `name CONTAINS 'Ali'`).
3. **Point Indexes:** For geographic searches (Lat/Long).

## Real-World Example: Real Estate Search

A property site uses Neo4j to model `House` locations.

- When a user searches for "Houses in Brooklyn," Neo4j uses a **Text Index** on the `neighborhood` property to find the first 100 houses.
- From those 100 houses, it then "traverses" to find nearby schools, supermarkets, and subway stations.
- The Index gets you the "Starting Seed," and the graph logic does the rest.

## Hypothetical Scenario: The "Selective" Index

A developer wants to index _every single property_ on their nodes.

- **The Result:** The database slows down! Every time they `CREATE` or `UPDATE` a node, Neo4j has to update 10 different indexes.
- **The Lesson:** Only index properties that you use in your `MATCH` or `WHERE` clauses.

## Exercises

1. **Benefit:** When is an index used in a Neo4j query?
2. **Drafting:** Write a command to create a range index for `Product(price)`.
3. **Comparison:** How is a `Full Scan` different from an `Index Seek`?

## Summary and Next Steps

Indexes are the "Receptionists" of your graph; they tell you where to find the first node so you can start your journey.

Next, we look at **Query Profiling**—how to see exactly what Neo4j is doing.
