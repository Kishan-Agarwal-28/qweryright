# Module 4 - Summary

Performance is the difference between a "Toy" and a "System."

---

## What we covered:

- **Constraints:** Using Uniqueness and Existence rules to protect data integrity.
- **Indexing:** Creating Range and Text indexes to find "Seed Nodes" quickly.
- **Profiling:** Using `EXPLAIN` and `PROFILE` to count DB Hits and avoid Cartesian Products.

---

## Key Takeaway

The "native" speed of Neo4j is a result of **Index-Free Adjacency**, but to get to that first node, you must have a proper **Indexing Strategy**. Without an index, every search starts with a slow scan of the whole database.

## Up Next: Module 5 - Graph Data Science (GDS)

Now that your graph is fast, it's time to make it smart. In the next module, we'll introduce the **Graph Data Science Library** and learn about algorithms like **PageRank**, **Community Detection**, and **Similarity**.
