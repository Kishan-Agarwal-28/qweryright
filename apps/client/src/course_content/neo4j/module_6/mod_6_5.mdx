# Module 6 - Summary

In this module, we bridged the gap between "Writing Queries" and "Building Apps."

---

## What we covered:

- **Drivers:** Connecting your Code (Node/Python) to the Database safely.
- **Sessions & Transactions:** Managing units of work to prevent memory leaks and data crashes.
- **APOC:** Extending Cypher with procedures for imports, dates, and batch processing.
- **Constraints:** Setting the rules of the house (Uniqueness and Existence).
- **AuraDB:** Moving your graph to the Cloud for production use.

---

## Key Takeaway

A database is only useful if it’s **reliable**. By using drivers correctly, enforcing constraints, and offloading heavy tasks to APOC, you ensure your Graph stays performant as your application grows from 10 users to 10 million.

## Up Next: Module 7 - Advanced Modeling & Final Project

In our final module, we will look at **Graph Modeling Anti-Patterns** (mistakes to avoid) and build a complete **Fraud Detection Graph** from scratch.
