# Where to Run Neo4j: Cloud vs local

You've been learning Neo4j, but where does the database actually live?

---

## 1. Neo4j Desktop (Local)

This is what you likely used for learning. It's free, runs on your machine, and is great for development.

- **Pro:** No internet required, maximum speed for local work.
- **Con:** If your laptop dies, your data is gone. Hard to share with a team.

## 2. Neo4j AuraDB (Cloud)

This is the "Managed" version of Neo4j. It's like RDS for SQL or Atlas for MongoDB.

- **Pro:** Zero maintenance. Automated backups. Scales automatically.
- **Con:** Costs money for larger datasets. Requires an internet connection to query.

## Real-World Example: Setting Up a "Service Account"

When moving to the Cloud, you don't use your personal login for your Node.js app. You create a **Service Account** with a restricted password.

**Aura Connection String:**
`neo4j+s://[DB_ID].databases.neo4j.io`

The `+s` tells the driver to use **Encrypted TLS** (Security is mandatory in the cloud!).

## Hypothetical Scenario: The "Regional Lag"

A company hosts their Neo4j Aura instance in the **US-East (Virginia)** region, but their app servers are in **EU-West (Ireland)**.
Every time the app asks for a friend list, the request has to travel 3,000 miles across the ocean and back. The app feels "sluggish."

**The Solution:** Always host your Database in the same physical region as your App Servers.

## Quick Exercises:

1. **Connection String**: What does the `+s` in `neo4j+s://` represent?
2. **Backups**: Why is it better to have a Cloud provider handle backups instead of doing it yourself on a local server?
3. **Environment Variables**: Why should you NEVER hardcode your AuraDB password in your GitHub repository? (Where should it go instead?)
