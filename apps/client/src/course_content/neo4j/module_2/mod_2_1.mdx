# Introduction to Cypher

**Cypher** is the query language for Neo4j. If SQL is about "SELECTing from Tables," Cypher is about **"Matching Patterns."**

The most beautiful thing about Cypher is that it is "ASCII Art" for your data.

## 1. Nodes in Cypher

We represent nodes with parentheses `()`. inside the parentheses, we put the labels and properties.

```cypher
(p:Person {name: "Alice", age: 30})
```

- `p` is a variable (alias).
- `:Person` is the label (like a table name).
- `{...}` are the properties.

---

## 2. Relationships in Cypher

We represent relationships with arrows `-->`.

```cypher
(p:Person)-[:FOLLOWS]->(m:Person)
```

- `[:FOLLOWS]` is the relationship type.
- The arrow `->` shows the direction.

## 3. The Pattern Match

A complete query looks like this:

```cypher
MATCH (a:Person)-[:FRIEND]->(b:Person)
WHERE a.name = "Alice"
RETURN b.name
```

_"Find someone named Alice, follow their 'FRIEND' connection, and tell me the name of the person at the other end."_

## Real-World Example: Recommendation Logic

You are on a music app.

```cypher
MATCH (u:User {name: "Bob"})-[:LIKES]->(s:Song)
RETURN s.title
```

- This simple pattern finds all songs Bob likes.
- In SQL, this would involve joining a `Users` table to a `Likes` table, then to a `Songs` table. In Cypher, it's a single, readable line.

## Hypothetical Scenario: The "Lost Connection"

A developer wants to find all their LinkedIn connections, but they can't remember if the person "Follows" them or if they "Follow" the person.

- **The Solution:** In Cypher, you can ignore the direction!
- `MATCH (me:Person {name: "Me"})-[:CONNECTED]-(them:Person)`
- By removing the arrow head, Neo4j finds the connection regardless of who started it.

## Exercises

1. **Syntax:** How do you represent a "Node" in Cypher?
2. **Reading:** Translate this into plain English: `(n:City {name: "Paris"})`.
3. **Logic:** Why is Cypher called "ASCII Art" for graphs?

## Summary and Next Steps

Cypher makes complex relationships easy to write and read.

Next, we learn how to **CREATE and MATCH** data in Neo4j.
