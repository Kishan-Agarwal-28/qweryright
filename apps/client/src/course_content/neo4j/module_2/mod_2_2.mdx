# CREATE and MATCH

In this lesson, we learn how to add data to our graph and how to find it later.

---

## 1. Creating Nodes

To add data, use the `CREATE` keyword.

```cypher
CREATE (n:Movie {title: "The Matrix", released: 1999})
```

_Note: If you run this twice, you will have two identical nodes. Neo4j does not automatically check for duplicates unless you set a constraint._

---

## 2. Creating Relationships

To create a relationship, you first have to **find** the nodes, then **draw** the line.

```cypher
MATCH (a:Person {name: "Keanu Reeves"})
MATCH (m:Movie {title: "The Matrix"})
CREATE (a)-[:ACTED_IN {role: "Neo"}]->(m)
```

---

## 3. Finding Data (MATCH)

`MATCH` is the most powerful keyword in Cypher.

```cypher
MATCH (m:Movie)
WHERE m.released > 2010
RETURN m.title
```

## Real-World Example: Building a Social Graph

A new user, Charlie, joins your app.

1. You `CREATE` the Charlie node.
2. Charlie follows Bob.

```cypher
MATCH (c:User {name: "Charlie"}), (b:User {name: "Bob"})
CREATE (c)-[:FOLLOWS]->(b)
```

3. Now, when Bob posts a photo, your app runs a `MATCH` to find everyone who follows Bob so they can get a notification.

## Hypothetical Scenario: The "Duplicate" Nightmare

A developer accidentally imports a list of 100 people twice. Now they have 200 nodes!

- **The Preventive Logic:** Instead of `CREATE`, use `MERGE`.
- `MERGE (p:Person {name: "Alice"})`
- `MERGE` behaves like "Create if it doesn't exist, else find it." This is a best practice for clean graphs.

## Exercises

1. **Creation:** Write a Cypher command to create a `Country` node with the name "Japan".
2. **Relationships:** How do you find two existing nodes and connect them?
3. **Logic:** What is the difference between `CREATE` and `MERGE`?

## Summary and Next Steps

Creating and finding data is the heartbeat of any database.

Next, we look at **Relationships** in more detail—including directed, undirected, and recursive ones!
