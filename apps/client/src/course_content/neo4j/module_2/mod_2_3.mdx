# Deep Dive: Relationships

Relationships are what make Neo4j a Graph Database. They have **Types**, **Directions**, and **Properties**.

---

## 1. Directed vs. Undirected

In Neo4j, all relationships **must** be stored with a direction.

- `(A)-[:PARENT_OF]->(B)` (Directed).
- `(A)-[:FRIEND_WITH]-(B)` (Undirected in a query, but stored as one direction behind the scenes).

_Tip: If the relationship is always mutual (like a marriage), just store it in one direction and query it without a direction._

## 2. Multiple Relationships

Two nodes can have multiple connections.

- `(User)-[:BOUGHT]->(Product)`
- `(User)-[:REVIEWED]->(Product)`
- `(User)-[:WISH_LISTED]->(Product)`

---

## 3. Relationship Properties

You can store data **on the relationship itself**.

- `(p:Person)-[:WORKS_AT {salary: 50000, since: 2020}]->(c:Company)`

---

## Real-World Example: Flight Booking

A flight between London and New York.

- Nodes: `City {name: "London"}`, `City {name: "New York"}`.
- Relationship: `[:FLIGHT {price: 400, airline: "British Airways", distance: 3450}]`.
- If the price changes, you don't update the London or New York nodes; you update the property on the **Relationship**.

## Hypothetical Scenario: The "Family Tree"

A genealogist is modeling a family.

- They have a relationship `[:CHILD_OF]`.
- To find a "Brother," they search for:
  `MATCH (me)-[:CHILD_OF]->(parent)<-[:CHILD_OF]-(sibling)`
- This "Zig-Zag" pattern matching is where Cypher shines. You are literally describing the family tree in text.

## Exercises

1. **Direction:** Does Neo4j store "Undirected" relationships on disk?
2. **Properties:** Give one example of a property you might store on a `[:FRIEND]` relationship.
3. **Logic:** How would you represent "User A likes User B, but User B does not like User A" in a graph?

## Summary and Next Steps

Relationships are the bridges between your data points.

Next, we look at **Labels and Filtering**—how to organize your nodes so they are easy to find.
