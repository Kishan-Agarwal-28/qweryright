# Module 2 - Summary

In this module, we learned the language of the graph: **Cypher**.

---

## What we covered:

- **Cypher Syntax:** Using parentheses `()` for nodes and arrows `-->` for relationships.
- **CREATE vs MERGE:** Ensuring data integrity and avoiding duplicates.
- **Relationship Mastery:** Using types, directions, and properties to build complex webs of data.
- **Filtering & Labels:** Organizing nodes and fetching exactly what you need with `WHERE`.

---

## Key Takeaway

Cypher is a **Declarative** language. You don't tell the database _how_ to find the data; you describe the _pattern_ you are looking for, and Neo4j does the hard work of traversal for you.

## Up Next: Module 3 - Advanced Traversal

Now that you can create a simple graph, it's time to find the deep secrets hidden within it. In the next module, we'll learn about **Variable Length Paths**, **Aggregations**, and finding the **Shortest Path** between two nodes.
