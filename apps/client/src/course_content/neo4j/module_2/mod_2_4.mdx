# Labels and Filtering

How do you keep your graph organized when you have millions of nodes? You use **Labels**.

---

## 1. Multi-Labels

In Neo4j, a node can have more than one label.

- A node could be a `:Person` AND an `:Actor`.
- `CREATE (n:Person:Actor {name: "Tom Hanks"})`

---

## 2. Filtering with WHERE

Just like SQL, you can use `WHERE` to narrow down your results.

```cypher
MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
WHERE p.born > 1980 AND m.title STARTS WITH "The"
RETURN p.name, m.title
```

---

## 3. The Power of Indexing Labels

When you query `(p:Person)`, Neo4j doesn't look at all nodes in the database. It only looks at nodes with the `:Person` label. This is like searching within a specific "Table" in SQL.

---

## Real-World Example: Content Management

A website has `Articles`, `Videos`, and `Images`.

- All of them share a `:Content` label.
- But they also have specific labels (`:Article`, `:Video`).
- If you want to search everything, you query `:Content`.
- If you only want to see videos, you query `:Video`.
- This "Hierarchy" makes searching very efficient.

## Hypothetical Scenario: The "VIP" User

An app has 1 million users. 500 of them are "VIPs."

- **Efficiency Hack:** Don't just put a `is_vip: true` property on the user.
- Add a `:VIP` label to the node!
- Now, when you want to send a message to all VIPs, Neo4j only looks at those 500 nodes instead of scanning all 1 million users for a boolean flag.

## Exercises

1. **Syntax:** Write a Cypher command to create a node with two labels: `Vehicle` and `Car`.
2. **Filtering:** How do you find a `Movie` where the `rating` is greater than 8.5?
3. **Logic:** Why is adding a "Label" better than a "Boolean Property" for large categories?

## Summary and Next Steps

Labels are the "Categories" of your graph.
