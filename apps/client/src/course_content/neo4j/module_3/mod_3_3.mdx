# Shortest Path

How do you get from Point A to Point B in the fewest steps? This is the core problem that Neo4j was born to solve.

---

## 1. The `shortestPath` function

Orama doesn't just find _any_ path; it uses an algorithm (usually Dijkstra or BFS) to find the absolute shortest one.

```cypher
MATCH (start:Person {name: "Me"}), (end:Person {name: "Kevin Bacon"})
MATCH p = shortestPath((start)-[:FRIEND*..15]-(end))
RETURN p
```

_"Find the shortest connection between Me and Kevin Bacon, up to 15 hops deep."_

---

## 2. Returning the whole Path

In the example above, `p` represents the entire **Path object**. This includes all the nodes and all the relationships between them. You can extract the nodes from `p` using `nodes(p)`.

---

## 3. All Shortest Paths

Sometimes there are two ways to get to a person in 3 hops. You can find both using `allShortestPaths`.

---

## Real-World Example: Logistical Routes

A delivery drone needs to travel from a Warehouse to a House.

- Every intersection is a **Node**.
- Every road is a **Relationship**.
- The drone uses `shortestPath` to calculate the route with the fewest intersections or (if the relationships have a `distance` property) the shortest total distance.

## Hypothetical Scenario: The "Networking" Goldmine

You want to meet the CEO of a company.

- You search a professional network graph.
- **The Query:** `shortestPath((Me)-[:CONNECTED*]-(CEO))`.
- The result shows: `Me -> Steve -> Sarah -> CEO`.
- Now you know that you should ask Steve to introduce you to Sarah!

## Exercises

1. **Syntax:** What function do you use to find the single shortest connection between two nodes?
2. **Logic:** Why is `allShortestPaths` different from `shortestPath`?
3. **Application:** In a map of a city, what would the "Nodes" and "Relationships" represent?

## Summary and Next Steps

Shortest Path is the ultimate "Graph Power."

We wrap up Module 3 in the next lesson.
