# Module 3 - Summary

In this module, we unlocked the advanced capabilities of graph traversal.

---

## What we covered:

- **Variable Length Paths:** Using the `*` operator to find "N-degree" connections.
- **Aggregations:** Using `count` and `collect` to summarize graph data into lists and stats.
- **Pathfinding:** Using `shortestPath` to find the most efficient route between two entities.

---

## Key Takeaway

Advanced traversal is about **discovery**. In a table, you can only find what you know to look for. In a graph, techniques like `*` and `shortestPath` allow the database to "discover" connections you didn't even know existed.

## Up Next: Module 4 - Performance & Indexing

Your graph is powerful, but is it fast? In the next module, we'll learn about **Constraints**, **Node Key Indexes**, and how to use the **Query Profiler** to find bottlenecks in your Cypher queries.
