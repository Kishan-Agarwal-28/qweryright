# Module 1 - Summary

In this module, we opened the door to the world of graphs.

---

## What we covered:

- **Nodes, Relationships, and Properties:** The building blocks of the Property Graph model.
- **Relational vs. Graph:** Learning when to use tables and when to use paths.
- **NGDB Architecture:** Why native storage and index-free adjacency beat index-based lookups.
- **Real-World Impact:** From fraud detection to investigating the Panama Papers.

## Key Takeaway

Neo4j is the best database for **Connected Data**. If your queries involve following a chain of relationships (e.g., "A knows B who knows C"), a graph database will always outperform a relational one.

## Up Next: Module 2 - Cypher Query Language

You understand the theory. Now it's time to write some code. In the next module, we'll learn **Cypher**, the "SQL of Graphs," and start creating our own nodes and relationships.
