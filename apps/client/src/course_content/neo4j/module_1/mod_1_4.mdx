# Modern Use Cases

Where does Neo4j shine in the industry? It's not just for social networks!

---

## 1. Personalization & Recommendation

- **Concept:** "People who bought this also bought that."
- **Why Graph?** By looking at the `PURCHASED` relationships across different users, Neo4j can instantly suggest products that are 2 or 3 "hops" away from your current browsing session.

---

## 2. Identity & Access Management (IAM)

- **Concept:** "Does User A have permission to read File Z?"
- **Why Graph?** In complex companies, permissions are inherited through a chain: `User -> Role -> Group -> Department -> Permission`.
- Neo4j can instantly verify the path from the User to the Permission.

## 3. Knowledge Graphs

- **Concept:** Connecting disparate pieces of information (e.g., Google Search).
- **Why Graph?** A Knowledge Graph connects strings (words) to things (entities). For example, it knows that "Apple" is a `Company`, and its CEO is `Tim Cook`.

## Real-World Example: The Panama Papers

In one of the largest journalism investigations in history, investigators used Neo4j to uncover how politicians and celebrities were hiding money.

- By loading millions of leaked emails and spreadsheets into a graph, they could see the connections between "Shell Companies," "Secret Bank Accounts," and "Final Owners."
- Patterns that were hidden in tables became visible in a graph.

## Hypothetical Scenario: The "Lost Package"

A shipping company tracks a package from China to London.

- The package goes through 5 airports, 3 cargo ships, and 12 trucks.
- **The Graph:** Every "Handshake" is a relationship.
- If a package is damaged, the company can query the graph to see which "Truck Driver" or "Warehouse" was the common denominator for all damaged packages that week.

## Exercises

1. **Permission:** How would you model a "User belongs to a Group" in Neo4j?
2. **Impact:** Why was Neo4j essential for the Panama Papers investigation?
3. **Brainstorm:** Think of one way a hospital could use a graph database.
