# Module 5 - The Ecosystem Summary

In this module, we moved away from standalone DuckDB and looked at how it fits into your modern toolkit.

---

## What we covered:

- **Python Integration:** How to use DuckDB inside Jupyter notebooks using `duckdb.sql()`.
- **WASM (In-Browser):** How DuckDB can power dashboards directly in a user's browser, bypassing the need for an expensive backend server.
- **dbt-duckdb:** How to use the SQL modeling power of dbt with the raw speed of DuckDB.
- **Data Quality:** Using `SUMMARIZE` and `CHECK` constraints to prevent bad data from ruining your analysis.

---

## Key Takeaway

DuckDB is rarely used in isolation. It is the "glue" that connects your raw files (Parquet/CSV) to your Python scripts, your dbt models, or your frontend dashboards.

## Up Next: Module 6 - Data Visualization and BI

Now that you have your data modeled and cleaned, how do you show it to people? In the next module, we'll see how DuckDB connects to tools like **Metabase, Tableau, and R-Shiny**.
