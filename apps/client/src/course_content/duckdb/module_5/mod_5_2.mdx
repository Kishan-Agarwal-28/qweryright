# DuckDB in the Browser (WASM)

Usually, databases require a server. But DuckDB has been compiled to **WebAssembly (WASM)**, which means you can run the entire database engine directly inside a user's web browser.

## 1. Zero-Backend Analytics

Traditionally, if you wanted to show a chart of 10 million rows, you would:

1. Send a request to a Server.
2. The Server queries a Database.
3. The Server sends JSON back to the Browser.
4. The Browser renders the chart.

With **DuckDB-WASM**, you can skip steps 1-3. The Browser downloads the data file once, and every "Filter" or "Sort" happens locally.

## 2. Speed and Privacy

1. **Speed:** Since there is no "Network Round Trip," clicking a filter button updates the UI instantly.
2. **Privacy:** The user's data never has to leave their computer. You can build a tool that analyzes sensitive "Medical" or "Financial" CSVs without ever seeing the data yourself.

## 3. Use-Cases

- **Interactive BI Dashboards:** Let users slice and dice data without loading the server.
- **SQL Tutorials:** Like the one you are reading now! You can provide a real SQL playground that runs in the browser.
- **Data Journalism:** Journalists can publish a story with a 10MB data file, and readers can explore it themselves.

## Real-World Example: "Evidence" and "Rill"

Tools like [Evidence.dev](https://evidence.dev) or Rill Data use DuckDB-WASM to build high-performance data reports.

- You open a webpage.
- It "pulls" a Parquet file from a CDN.
- As you move sliders and change dates, the SQL queries run at 60 frames per second right on your machine.

## Hypothetical Scenario: The "Offline" Dashboard

A construction manager is on a remote site with no internet.

- They have a web app they downloaded previously.
- They drag a CSV from their local machine into the browser.
- **The Result:** Even without internet, DuckDB-WASM parses the CSV and shows them their progress charts.

## Exercises

1. **Technology:** What is WASM (WebAssembly)? (In simple terms).
2. **Privacy:** Why is DuckDB-WASM better for privacy than a traditional database?
3. **Latency:** Why is an interactive dashboard faster with DuckDB-WASM?

## Summary and Next Steps

DuckDB-WASM is the future of interactive data.

But for professional data engineers, there is another tool that is essential: **dbt**. Next, we look at how DuckDB powers the testing and transformation of data.
