# Interactive Apps: Streamlit & R-Shiny

Sometimes a static dashboard isn't enough. You need **interactive** filters, buttons, and user inputs. For this, Python developers use **Streamlit** and R developers use **Shiny**.

## 1. DuckDB + Streamlit (Python)

Streamlit is the fastest way to build a web app in Python. Pairing it with DuckDB makes it a speed demon.

```python
import streamlit as st
import duckdb

# Input from the user
min_price = st.slider("Select Minimum Price", 0, 1000)

# Query DuckDB
df = duckdb.query(f"SELECT * FROM 'data.parquet' WHERE price > {min_price}").to_df()

# Show the chart
st.line_chart(df)
```

---

## 2. DuckDB + Shiny (R)

R users love DuckDB because it is compatible with `dbplyr`.

```r
library(shiny)
library(duckdb)

con <- dbConnect(duckdb(), "my_db.db")

# In the server logic
prices <- tbl(con, "products") %>%
  filter(price > input$min_price) %>%
  collect()
```

## 3. The "In-Process" Advantage

In many web apps, every time a user drags a slider, the app has to send a request over the internet to a database (like Postgres). This causes a "lag."

- With DuckDB, the database can run **inside the web server process**.
- There is zero network latency. The app feels "instant."

## Real-World Example: Real Estate Search

A real estate website allows users to filter 10 million home listings by Zip Code and Square Footage.

- By using DuckDB-WASM or a local DuckDB file on the server, the filters happen in real-time as the user moves the slider.
- No "Loading..." spinners. Just raw speed.

---

## Hypothetical Scenario: The "Disconnected" Field Agent

A data scientist needs to go to a remote location with no internet.

- They have a Streamlit app running on their laptop.
- Because DuckDB is a local file, they can search and analyze millions of rows of survey data without needing a Wi-Fi connection.

## Exercises

1. **Latency:** Why is DuckDB faster for "Slider-based" filters than a cloud database?
2. **Code:** Look at the Python example. What DuckDB command converts the results to a format Streamlit understands?
3. **Architecture:** Where exactly does DuckDB "live" when used inside a Streamlit app?

## Summary and Next Steps

Interactive apps put the power of DuckDB in the hands of everyday users.

In the next lesson, we'll learn how to **tune the performance** of these dashboards so they stay fast as data grows.
