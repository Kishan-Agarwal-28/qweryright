# Module 6 - Data Visualization Summary

In this module, we bridged the gap between raw data and visual insights.

---

## What we covered:

- **BI Connections:** Using MotherDuck and JDBC to connect to tools like Metabase and Tableau.
- **Evidence.dev:** The "SQL + Markdown" approach to building professional data reports.
- **Interactive Apps:** Speeding up Python (Streamlit) and R (Shiny) apps by running DuckDB "in-process."
- **Dashboard Tuning:** Using Hive Partitioning and Projection Pushdown to handle large datasets.

---

## Key Takeaway

DuckDB's speed is most visible when it powers a dashboard. By eliminating network lag and using columnar scanning, you can build tools that feel significantly faster than traditional cloud-based SQL dashboards.

## Up Next: Module 7 - Advanced Data Modeling and Constraints

In our final module, we go deep into **Schema Design**. We'll learn how to handle JSON nested data, how to create custom Data Types (ENUMs), and how to manage large-scale migrations in DuckDB.
