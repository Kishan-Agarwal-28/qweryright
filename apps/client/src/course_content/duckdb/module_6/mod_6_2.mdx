# DuckDB + Evidence.dev: BI for Developers

Traditional BI tools (like Power BI) are "Drag and Drop." **Evidence.dev** is "Code First." It allows you to build data reports using Markdown and SQL.

---

## 1. How it Works

Evidence uses DuckDB as its internal engine.

- You write a Markdown file.
- You embed a SQL query inside the Markdown.
- Evidence runs the query through DuckDB and renders a chart.

---

## 2. Example: A Simple Report

````markdown
# Annual Sales Report

<DataTable data={sales_data} />

<LineChart data={sales_data} x=month y=revenue />

```sql sales_data
SELECT
    date_trunc('month', sale_date) as month,
    sum(amount) as revenue
FROM read_parquet('sales/*.parquet')
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
```
````

```

## 3. Why this is the "Future"

1. **Version Control:** Your dashboards are just Markdown files. You can save them in Git (GitHub).
2. **Speed:** Because it uses DuckDB, the charts are lightning-fast.
3. **Parquet Integration:** Evidence can query Parquet files directly from your computer or S3.

## Real-World Example: The Automated Monthly Audit

A DevOps team uses Evidence + DuckDB to monitor server costs.
- Every month, they drop a CSV of AWS costs into a `/data` folder.
- Evidence automatically updates the SQL-driven charts.
- The team commits the Markdown file to Git, so they have a history of every report ever generated.

---

## Hypothetical Scenario: The "Excel Killer"

A data analyst is tired of copying and pasting SQL results into Excel to make a graph for their boss.
- **The Solution:** They set up Evidence.
- Now, they just click "Save" on their SQL query, and the professional-looking dashboard is already prepared for their boss.

## Exercises

1. **Comparison:** How is "Code-First BI" different from "Drag-and-Drop BI"?
2. **Setup:** Why does Evidence include DuckDB by default?
3. **Logic:** What are the benefits of keeping your dashboards in a Git repository?

## Summary and Next Steps

Evidence.dev shows that SQL + Markdown is a powerful duo.

Next, we look at **Streamlit and R-Shiny**—how to build interactive web apps with DuckDB.
