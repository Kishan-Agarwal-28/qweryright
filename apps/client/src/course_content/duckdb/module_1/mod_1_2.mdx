# Installation and CLI Basics

DuckDB is famously easy to install. There are no dependencies and no environment variables to configure.

---

## 1. Getting the CLI

The Command Line Interface (CLI) is a single executable file.

- **macOS:** `brew install duckdb`
- **Windows:** `choco install duckdb` or download the `.exe` from duckdb.org.
- **Linux:** Download the binary directly.

---

## 2. Launching DuckDB

To start an "In-Memory" session (data is lost when you close it):

```bash
duckdb
```

To start a persistent session (data is saved to a file):

```bash
duckdb my_analysis.db
```

---

## 3. Useful Dot Commands

Inside the DuckDB shell, you use "dot commands" to control the environment:

- **`.help`**: List all commands.
- **`.tables`**: List all tables in the database.
- **`.schema`**: See the SQL used to create your tables.
- **`.mode box`**: Makes the output look clean and readable.
- **`.exit`** or `.quit`: Close the session.

---

## 4. Your First "Query"

One of DuckDB's coolest features is that you don't even need a table to write SQL.

```sql
SELECT 1 + 1 AS result;

SELECT * FROM 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/iris.csv' LIMIT 5;
```

_Wait, did we just query a URL?_ Yes. DuckDB can treat remote files as tables automatically.

---

## Real-World Example: Fast CSV Preview

You just downloaded a 500MB CSV file and you want to see the column names.

- You open your terminal.
- Run `duckdb`.
- Type `DESCRIBE SELECT * FROM 'data.csv';`
- Total time: < 2 seconds. No need to open heavy software.

---

## Hypothetical Scenario: The "Dirty" Data

A developer is trying to import a CSV that has mixed date formats.

- In many databases, the import would fail.
- In DuckDB, they use the `read_csv_auto` function. DuckDB "sniffs" the data, realizes what the developer is trying to do, and handles the conversion automatically.

## Exercises

1. **Commands:** How do you launch DuckDB and save your work to a file named `finance.db`?
2. **Help:** Which dot command shows you the structure of your current tables?
3. **Syntax:** Write a SQL query in DuckDB to multiply 50 by 2.

## Summary and Next Steps

The CLI is great for exploration, but DuckDB is most powerful when it's embedded in your code.

Next, we look at the difference between **In-process memory** and **Standalone files**.
