# Terms of Service

**Last Updated: December 31, 2025**

Hi, I'm **[Your Name/Kishan]**. I built **[Project Name]** to help people learn SQL and MongoDB.

By using this website, you agree to play nice. I am doing my best to keep this site running, helpful, and secure. In return, I ask that you don't abuse the system, harass other users, or try to break things.

Since I am a solo developer and this is a free/freemium tool, I cannot promise that the site will be perfect 100% of the time.

---

## 1. The Agreement

By logging in or using the code editors on this site, you agree to these Terms. If you don't agree with them, please don't use the site.

## 2. Accounts

- **Authentication:** You log in using third-party providers (Google, GitHub, etc.). You are responsible for keeping those accounts secure.
- **One Person, One Account:** Please don't create 50 accounts to game the leaderboard or abuse the free tier limits.
- **Termination:** I reserve the right to ban your account if you violate these rules. (I really don't want to do this, so just be cool).

## 3. How You Can Use The Site

This platform allows you to run database queries right in your browser (using technologies like PGLite and WebLLM).

**You Agree To:**

- Use the site for learning and practicing.
- Be respectful in comments or community solutions.

**You Agree NOT To:**

- Attempt to crash the site (DDoS, spamming API requests).
- Reverse engineer the proprietary parts of the code.
- Use the "Cloud AI" features to generate abusive or illegal content.
- Scrape all the content to build a clone competitor (c'mon, that's not cool).

## 4. Content & Ownership

**My Content:**
The design, the learning modules, the specific database problems, and the platform code are owned by me (**[Project Name]**).

**Your Content:**
You own the code snippets and solutions you write. However, by submitting them to the platform (e.g., posting a public solution), you give me permission to display them to other users and store them in the database so the site works.

## 5. The "No Warranty" Clause (Important)

_This is the part where I protect myself legally._

I am a single developer, not a multinational corporation with 99.999% uptime SLAs.

**THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS IS".**

- I do not guarantee the site will always be available.
- I do not guarantee that your data (streaks, saved queries) will never be lost (though I take backups).
- I am not responsible if you learn SQL here, get a job, and then accidentally delete your company's production database. Please use your best judgment.

## 6. AI Disclaimer

This site uses AI (Google Gemini and local WebLLM) to help explain code and optimize queries.

- **AI makes mistakes.** Do not blindly trust the AI's suggestions.
- **Educational Use Only.** The code generated by the AI is for learning. Do not copy-paste it into a mission-critical banking system without testing it first.

## 7. Fees and Payments

Right now, the service is free (or has free tiers).
In the future, I may add "Pro" features to help pay for server costs. If I do, I will clearly clearly list the prices. I will never charge your card without your explicit consent.

## 8. Third-Party Links

I might link to documentation (MDN, Postgres docs) or other resources. I am not responsible for what happens on those other websites.

## 9. Changes to Terms

I might update these terms as the project grows. If I make big changes (like changing how data is owned), I will try to notify you via the dashboard or email.

## 10. Contact

If you have a problem, found a bug, or just want to clarify something in these terms, please reach out.

**Email:** [Your Email]
**GitHub:** [Your GitHub Profile Link]
