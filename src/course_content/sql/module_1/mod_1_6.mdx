# Using WHERE Clause for Filtering Rows

Up to this point, our queries have retrieved every single row from a table. In a real-world database with millions of records, this is rarely what you want. Usually, you need to find specific information: a particular customer, orders placed on a specific date, or products within a certain price range.

The `WHERE` clause is the tool we use to filter data. It allows you to specify a condition; only the rows that meet this condition will be included in the result. This lesson will explore how to use the `WHERE` clause with various comparison operators to precisely target the data you need.

## The WHERE Clause: Filtering Data

The `WHERE` clause is added after the `FROM` clause in a SQL statement. It acts like a gatekeeper: it examines each row in the table and asks, "Does this row satisfy the condition?" If the answer is **True**, the row is returned. If **False**, the row is discarded.

### Basic Syntax

```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

### Comparison Operators

To build a condition, you use comparison operators. Here are the most common ones in SQL:

| Operator | Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `=` | Equal to | `WHERE age = 25` |
| `>` | Greater than | `WHERE price > 100` |
| `<` | Less than | `WHERE stock < 10` |
| `>=` | Greater than or equal to | `WHERE age >= 18` |
| `<=` | Less than or equal to | `WHERE price <= 50` |
| `<>` or `!=` | Not equal to | `WHERE status != 'Cancelled'` |

### Handling Different Data Types

*   **Numbers:** Do not use quotes.
    *   Correct: `WHERE price = 10.99`
    *   Incorrect: `WHERE price = '10.99'` (Usually works, but bad practice)
*   **Text/Strings:** Must be enclosed in **single quotes**.
    *   Correct: `WHERE name = 'Alice'`
    *   Incorrect: `WHERE name = Alice` (Database thinks Alice is a column name)
*   **Dates:** Must be enclosed in **single quotes**, typically in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format.
    *   Correct: `WHERE order_date = '2023-12-25'`

## Practical Examples and Demonstrations

Let's apply these filtering techniques to our **Online Bookstore** database.

### Scenario 1: Finding a Specific Book
A customer asks if you have the book "1984" in stock. You need to find that specific record.

**Query:**
```sql
SELECT title, price, stock_quantity
FROM books
WHERE title = '1984';
```

**Result:**
The database looks at every book. It skips "The Great Gatsby", skips "Pride and Prejudice", and only returns the row where the title is exactly '1984'.

### Scenario 2: Finding Affordable Books
You want to create a "Bargain Bin" section for books that cost less than $10.

**Query:**
```sql
SELECT title, price
FROM books
WHERE price < 10.00;
```

**Result:**
This will return all books with a price like 8.99, 5.00, or 9.99. It will exclude any book costing 10.00 or more.

### Scenario 3: Finding Orders Not Yet Shipped
The logistics team needs a list of all orders that are still pending shipment. In our `Orders` table, we have a boolean column `is_shipped`.

**Query:**
```sql
SELECT order_id, customer_name
FROM orders
WHERE is_shipped = FALSE;
```

**Result:**
This returns only the orders where the shipping status is false (pending).

### Scenario 4: Filtering by Date
You want to see all orders placed on New Year's Day, 2024.

**Query:**
```sql
SELECT *
FROM orders
WHERE order_date = '2024-01-01';
```

## Exercises and Practice Activities

To solidify your understanding of the `WHERE` clause, complete the following exercises.

### Exercise 1: Basic Filtering
Using the `Books` table (columns: `title`, `author`, `price`, `stock_quantity`):
1.  Write a query to find all books written by 'George Orwell'.
2.  Write a query to find all books that cost exactly $12.50.
3.  Write a query to find all books where the stock quantity is greater than or equal to 100.

### Exercise 2: Negative Filtering
Using the `Orders` table (columns: `order_id`, `status`, `total`):
1.  Write a query to find all orders where the status is **NOT** 'Completed'. (Hint: Use the `<>` or `!=` operator).

### Exercise 3: Data Type Check
Identify the error in the following query and rewrite it correctly:
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE last_name = Smith;
```

## Concluding Thoughts

In this lesson, we unlocked the power of filtering. The `WHERE` clause is one of the most essential tools in SQL, allowing you to narrow down massive datasets to just the relevant information. We learned how to use standard comparison operators (`=`, `>`, `<`) and how to properly format values for numbers, text, and dates.

Looking ahead, the next module (Module 2) will take our filtering skills to the next level. We will learn how to combine multiple conditions using logical operators like `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` (e.g., "Find books that are under $10 AND written by Orwell"). We will also explore how to modify data—inserting, updating, and deleting records—transforming us from passive readers of data to active managers of it.
