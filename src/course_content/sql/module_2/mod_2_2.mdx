# Updating Existing Records (UPDATE)

Data is rarely permanent. Customers change their addresses, product prices fluctuate, and order statuses move from "Processing" to "Shipped." In a relational database, we modify existing records using the `UPDATE` statement. This lesson will guide you through the syntax and safety precautions required when changing data.

## Understanding the UPDATE Statement

The `UPDATE` statement allows you to modify the values of one or more columns in existing rows. Unlike `INSERT`, which adds new rows, `UPDATE` changes the data *inside* the rows that are already there.

### Basic Syntax

```sql
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = new_value1, column2 = new_value2
WHERE condition;
```

*   **`UPDATE`**: Specifies the table you want to modify.
*   **`SET`**: Lists the columns to change and the new values they should receive.
*   **`WHERE`**: **Crucial!** Specifies *which* rows should be updated.

### The Danger of Omitting WHERE
If you omit the `WHERE` clause, the database assumes you want to update **every single row** in the table.
*   *Dangerous Example:* `UPDATE products SET price = 0;`
*   *Result:* Every product in your store is now free. This is a common and catastrophic mistake for beginners. Always double-check your `WHERE` clause.

## Practical Examples and Demonstrations

We continue with our **Online Bookstore** scenario.

### Scenario 1: Updating a Single Record
A customer, "Alice Wonderland", has moved. We need to update her email address in the `Customers` table.

**Query:**
```sql
UPDATE customers
SET email = 'alice.new@example.com'
WHERE customer_id = 1;
```

**Result:**
The database finds the row where `customer_id` is 1 and changes the `email` column. All other columns (name, join date) remain unchanged.

### Scenario 2: Updating Multiple Columns
We realized that for the book "1984", we had the wrong price *and* the wrong stock count. We need to fix both at once.

**Query:**
```sql
UPDATE books
SET price = 14.99, stock_quantity = 50
WHERE title = '1984';
```

### Scenario 3: Bulk Updates
The store is having a sale! We want to discount all books in the "Fiction" genre by 10%. We can use a mathematical expression in the `SET` clause.

**Query:**
```sql
UPDATE books
SET price = price * 0.90
WHERE genre = 'Fiction';
```

**Result:**
The database looks at every book. If the genre is 'Fiction', it takes the *current* price, multiplies it by 0.90, and saves the result as the *new* price. Books in "Non-Fiction" are untouched.

## Exercises and Practice Activities

To solidify your understanding of updating data, complete the following exercises.

### Exercise 1: Correcting a Typo
In the `Authors` table, the author "George Orwell" was accidentally entered as "George Orwel". Write a query to fix his last name. Assume his `author_id` is 2.

### Exercise 2: Updating Status
In the `Orders` table, order #5001 has been shipped. Write a query to change its `is_shipped` status to `TRUE`.

### Exercise 3: Safety Check
You need to update the price of "The Great Gatsby". You write:
```sql
UPDATE books
SET price = 12.99;
```
What will happen when you run this? How should you fix it?

## Concluding Thoughts

In this lesson, we learned how to modify existing data using the `UPDATE` statement. We emphasized the critical importance of the `WHERE` clause to prevent accidental mass updates. We also saw how to update multiple columns simultaneously and how to perform calculations during an update.

In the next lesson, we will cover the final aspect of basic data manipulation: removing data. We will learn how to use the `DELETE` statement to remove records from our tables, and again, why the `WHERE` clause is your best friend in preventing data disasters.
