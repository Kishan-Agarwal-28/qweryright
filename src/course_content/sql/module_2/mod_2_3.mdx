# Deleting Records from Tables (DELETE FROM)

Sometimes, data is no longer needed. A customer requests to close their account, an order is cancelled, or a product is discontinued. In these cases, we need to remove records from our database. The `DELETE` statement is the tool for this job. It is powerful and permanent, so it must be used with extreme caution.

## Understanding the DELETE Statement

The `DELETE FROM` statement removes one or more rows from a table. Unlike `UPDATE`, which changes values *within* a row, `DELETE` removes the entire row completely.

### Basic Syntax

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

*   **`DELETE FROM`**: Specifies the table to remove data from.
*   **`WHERE`**: **Crucial!** Specifies *which* rows to remove.

### The Danger of Omitting WHERE
Just like with `UPDATE`, if you omit the `WHERE` clause, the database assumes you want to delete **every single row** in the table.
*   *Dangerous Example:* `DELETE FROM customers;`
*   *Result:* Your `Customers` table is now empty. All customer data is gone.

## Practical Examples and Demonstrations

We continue with our **Online Bookstore** scenario.

### Scenario 1: Deleting a Specific Record
A customer has cancelled Order #1005. We need to remove it from the system.

**Query:**
```sql
DELETE FROM orders
WHERE order_id = 1005;
```

**Result:**
The row with `order_id` 1005 is removed. All other orders remain.

### Scenario 2: Deleting Multiple Records
We decided to stop selling "Magazines". We want to remove all products from the `Books` table that are in the 'Magazine' category.

**Query:**
```sql
DELETE FROM books
WHERE category = 'Magazine';
```

**Result:**
The database finds all rows where the category is 'Magazine' and deletes them.

### Scenario 3: Referential Integrity (The Safety Net)
What happens if you try to delete an Author who has written books that are still in your `Books` table?
*   If you try: `DELETE FROM authors WHERE author_id = 101;` (J.K. Rowling)
*   **Result:** The database will likely stop you with an error: "Foreign key constraint violation."
*   **Reason:** Relational databases are designed to prevent "orphan" records. You cannot have a book that points to an author who doesn't exist. To delete the author, you must first delete their books (or reassign them).

## Exercises and Practice Activities

To solidify your understanding of deleting data, complete the following exercises.

### Exercise 1: Removing a User
Write a query to delete the customer with `customer_id` 50 from the `Customers` table.

### Exercise 2: Cleaning Up Old Data
Write a query to delete all orders that were placed before '2020-01-01'. (Hint: Use the `<` operator with the date).

### Exercise 3: The "Empty Table" Mistake
Explain what the following query does and why it is dangerous:
```sql
DELETE FROM products;
```

## Concluding Thoughts

In this lesson, we learned how to remove data using the `DELETE` statement. We reinforced the critical importance of the `WHERE` clause to avoid wiping out entire tables. We also touched on the concept of Referential Integrity, which prevents us from accidentally breaking links between related tables (like Authors and Books).

In the next lesson, we will return to data retrieval (`SELECT`), but with much more power. We will learn how to combine multiple conditions using Logical Operators (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`), allowing us to ask complex questions like "Show me all fiction books that cost less than $15 AND are in stock."
